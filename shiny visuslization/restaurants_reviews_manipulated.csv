  Really like this place. Great atmosphere, friendly service (mostly) and tasty food. Nice wine list but with an expensive lean. Had some great dishes, however both fish dishes were quite overcooked. An amateur move for a veteran and at these prices.

  Another place downtown that has seen better days. We went a year or so back, so this review is a tad bit tardy, but the steak was a tad bit overcooked for rare, and the second one was too undercooked for medium.

Whilst EMP offers a degustation menu only, there are some choices too make. Options for the salad, fish course, main and dessert meant between the two of us we got quite the selection! 10 courses latter, we were so happy that we decided to make a return visit!",28-Apr-16,Where Will We Eat

  I had the pleasure of enjoying lunch at Eleven Madison Park last September and can honestly say it was the most incredible, mind blowing meal I?ve ever had. 

Everything was perfect: the food, the presentation, the service. 

Science, art, gastronomy, love - evident on every plate.

Hubs is a fussy eater, however his affliction actually turned out to be highly advantageous for our EMP experience. 
Caviar, fish and foie gras courses were replaced with alternative dishes, which meant I got to sample several additional plates, which [of course] were all amazing. In fact, hubs? off piste eggs benedict with truffles trumped my standard eggs benedict with caviar!

This was a wonderful way to finish our NY trip. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. 

I hope to visit NY again and Eleven Madison Park will definitely be on the itinerary.",9-Apr-16,MT

The most recent funeral oration is that given by Jay Rayner, in the Guardian, where he refers  to a survey which states that 70% of diners have turned against fine dining, linking to a headline in The Times, which declares that  ?Fussy French dining loses out to relaxed rioja and tapas?. ...

  Dining at Eleven Madison Park is for sure one of the best culinary experience I had and trust me: I had many. No wonder how this place got some many accolades, from 3 Michelin stars since 2012, to James Beard Awards to name a few: the service was impeccable and the food was not only creative, but also fantastically presented and delicious. Know that they only offer a tasting menu and there is no a la carte, so your meal with take few hours for the pleasure of your eyes, palate and stomach. We even got the chance to meet with Executive Chef and owner Daniel Humm and chatted a bit about the menu that will change in couple of weeks, being a smaller tasting, but still showcasing local ingredients. ...

  We ended up getting seated in the bar. However, bear in mind that our total bill was >$600. Thus, you should expect solid service. However, the service was pathetic and the food, from the a la carte menu, was good but not memorable. For that price the food should have been special. Perhaps the worst part of the experience was the sense that we were ""fortunate to be in their restaurant"". I hate nonsense like that.

  The interiors are gorgeous, with an art deco design and large windows that provide a great view.
The vegetarian tasting menu was full of innovative dishes like a grain free celery root risotto and turnips cooked four ways in turnip broth. They also had twists on classic New York dishes like the Waldorf Salad and a vegetarian take on Oysters Rockefeller, which was quite interesting. The review on my blog has more details about the meal, so do check it out. 

It was a long, but divine 3 and a half hour experience, not to mention the food coma that came afterwards!

  The last night of our trip to the Big Apple was spent at Eleven Madison Park which holds 3 Michelin stars and is rated the 4th best restaurant in the world by San Pellegrino. We arrived early and were led to the bar to enjoy some cocktails as the team briefing with a huge brigade was held on the dining floor. The restaurant is set in an impressive art deco building with a high gold leaf ceiling. A long tasting menu at $225 per head is served for lunch and dinner service alongside a limited menu in the bar area. The meal began with a small envelope containing a card with four choices, coffee, celery, cherry and strawberry.

   Wonderful Dining Experience Will Go Again!. We went for a romantic and memorable dinner at 11 Madison. We booked more than 30 days out from Vancouver, BC Canada and could only get a late reservation and had thoughts of cancelling but were told by many including our hotel staff to definitely go.

We had the tasting menu with the wine pairings. The sommelier came by to ask us what wines we enjoyed drinking so they could ensure they were included and that rarely happens in our experience. Loved the menu concept but don't want to tell you ahead of time to spoil the surprise. Definintely in the top 2 best dinners we had in New York. We considered this our best more modern style restaurant meal. Service was fabulous. The food was beautifully presented and tasted delicious and we have been fortunate to eat in some of the worlds best restaurants.

  I have always loved serendipity 3. I just love coming here whenever I visit New York. My favourite is Frozen hot chocolate. Just delicious , mouth watering and with the big portion , its hard to share.
It always has long waits, but its definitely worth the wait as what you get later on; is huge portion size, which any girl loves.",5 months ago,Tamanna

  I thoroughly enjoyed Serendipity 3, however that being said, I did not find them as profound as I'd heard they were. They had tasty milkshakes, not the best I've had. And the food was normal considering the price you pay. They get a lot of buzz but as much as I liked it I don't think it's worth the price. The most I'd insist on going there for is the ground floor seating decoration. Which we didn't really get to see because we were seated upstairs.",7 months ago,Nadia T

  This place has the best desserts in my opinion, they never disappoint. Their food, or should I say ""serious food"" is really good. I always go for the burgers. The place is always full, at least the times that I have visited, I've had to wait anywhere from 30- 1hr and a half. This just goes to show how popular this place is NYC and with good reason. The place is also not huge, so I guess that makes a difference. I also love the decor; they did a great job with it. I feel like that attracts a lot of people as well.",8 months ago,Jesse Ham

  Love love love this place. Every time I go to New York, this is on my must do list. We've only had dessert here and the frozen hot chocolate is a brilliant creation. It is so big that even between the two of us, we can't finish half of it.
Confession, I was first drawn to this place because of the movie, Serendipity, staring Kate Beckinsale. It still remains as one of my favourite movies - you must watch it if you haven't! It's a rom com that will make you laugh and cry, and help you believe in fate.",9 months ago,Jadie

  After watching Serendipity and Gossip Girls, when you go to NYC, the first thing you do is that you go to Serendipity and live the dream.

Yes stepping inside this place and just like a dream come true.

You feel as if you are walking into a dreamland. Everything from lamps to walls looks just out of fairy tale.

I have been just lucky that I went to this on its 60th Anniversary.

Serendipity is a small dessert place on the UPPER EAST SIDE and a small black door.

This is famous for its Frozen Hot Chocolate and without any delay I ordered the same.

It is served in a big bowl, which you would first feel is too small for you but once you start sipping it, the bowl never ends.

Must try once in lifetime and do go with your partner or best buddy.

  On the upper east side of town, en route to the Met Museum, we took a slight detour to visit the store Serendipity 3. The stores name has a lovely origin that you can read all about on their website but the meaning of the word is ?the art of finding the pleasantly unexpected by chance or sagacity? A word invented by eighteenth century wordsmith Sir Horace Walpole. The 3 refers to the three original owners that each put in $100 to start the venture. ...

We waited for 20 minutes to be seated and then we went to order and were informed there was an 8.50 minimum per person something that was never mentioned at the door.

   What awful service!. An hour wait to get a soda???? Really? After waiting an hour for a table at 4 pm, we waited, once sitting, an hour for them to bring drinks. I asked the waiter about our drinks, and then never saw him again (did he quit or just tell some poor lower waiter to take over?)? Food was OK, but amazingly long wait for a sandwich.

Maybe non-existent is a better description. I don't have family, friends or business in New York. All past trips have been purely hedonistic, with food always at the top of my list. I visit all the tourist traps. I can't help it. I am a tourist when I'm there, a downtown poser in every sense of the word. Every trip has consisted of visits to the Empire State Building, Tavern on the Green, a carriage ride through Central Park and Serendipity 3 . Serendipity 3 reminds of a place you would celebrate your sweet sixteen. A glorified malt shop with faux Tiffany lamps, long lines, marginal service and so-so food. However, they won't let you make a reservation for just dessert...you have to eat a meal. So we would eat....just to get dessert. There is only one reason I patronized Serendipity 3...for the Frozen Hot Chocolate. It's out of this world. Served in a very large bowl-dish-mug thingy with a straw or two...it's ove ...

It was a little bit cramped - crowded. Waited about an hour get in- but I just chalked that up to be a popular resturant.

I did purchase a package of frozen hot chocolate - alittle pricey. It s okay- not great.

The famed frozen hot chocolate was a diabetic and weight watcher's nightmare, but was sweet and delicious.

Ordered the BLT and Cheddar burger. The food was alright, but nothing spectacular. The BLT was huge though, so it could be shared. The real reason we went though was because I wanted a frozen hot chocolate. I remember the one I had in Vegas being better, but it was still delicious.

   A Fun Experience. I had heard a lot about this place and decided to check it out to see if it lived up to the hype. Glad to say that it did.

It was late night and the place was crowded, but I didn't have to wait to get a table. Service was brisk, but friendly enough. The decor was fun and the ice cream treats were amazing. Add in the illustrious history of this place and you have a winner.

The ice cream itself is very good. I believe they use Haagen Daaz ice cream. They became too busy to use their own production some time ago. At least, this is what my waiter told me.

In addition to the delicious nature of their creations, they put a lot of effort into presentation as well. I saw a lot of people taking pictures of their orders with cell phone cameras, before digging in with their spoons.

The prices are a bit high, but I would definitely go back again.",15-Jun-10,Intrepid Diner

My daughter finally talked me into taking her to Serendipity and although it was a nice ice cream experience (that we were forced to combine with dinner) I do not think I will be doing it again anytime soon.

We went for afternoon tea and there was a 1 1/2 hour wait. Fortunately, you can leave your name and then wonder off to Bloomies (which we did). When we returned almost 1 1/2 hours later, we still had to wait another 30 minutes. I felt as if I were in a line at an amusement park and that is something I do not cherish.

So, my advice is that if you have to have this fix, make a reservation (preferably months in advance) and you will be able to walk straight in. Otherwise, do not wait in line.

   Ignore the wait.... If the wait time mortifies you, presume it most likely frightened away the 5 tables ahead of you, as well, and you are actually next on the list. These folks love to over quote, so don't drift too far. When you finally do sit down, don't fool yourself. Skip the savory, and head straight to the sweet. When a menu offers a $1,000 Golden Opulence Sundae, it's okay to have a dessert (or two) as your entree.",3-Apr-10,Amuse Bouche

   Serendipity. Wait and like it.. For all the naysayers out there, if you know what to expect when you go (which is almost always a long wait) I think it's worth it. I either go when I know there wont be a line or I go an dexpect to walk around the neighborhood for an hour or so. The food is nothing amazing, but the Summer Brees sandwich and FroHo (naturally) are favs. It was also a first date place for me and my gf now of 3.5 years!!

   It is not that serious..... Ok, so we had reservations but for those who didnt..the wait time was over 2HOURS!!! once we were in, i saw that the decor was absolutely atrocious! it seemed like every grandmother was called upon to find their oldest dustiest flower curtains and whatever else they had and threw it around the restaurant. the food was flavorless but if i could order something different i would have what my sister ordered which was the ""Chicken Diva"" meal. we also ordered the frozen hot chocolate and it was pretty tasty.

now to the Dessert! They had the most delicious biggest portions i have ever seen or had! my table of four shared the strawberry cheescake sundae and also the black chocolate sundae. absolutely amazing! it was a bit pricey for a sundae but if i ever go back i would skip the meal and just order the sundaes.

would i ever go back maybe but its not at the top of my list...too small, too long of a wait time...and food is not that great.",8-Mar-10,The Food Critic

   It would be faster to fly to the one in Vegas. While in town, we stopped by to see what all the fuss was about. Hostess at the front told us in a very smug voice, ""90 minutes, come back in an hour to check in"". No desserts in the world is worth a 90 minute wait, and who knows how much longer to get your order in and be served.

  Welcome to the Spotted Pig, April Bloomfield?s cosy gastropub in Chelsea. You?ll find it by the cute spotted pig hanging above the entrance out in the lush front garden. April Bloomfield is an English chef with great credentials, she was originally scouted by Mario Batali before moving to New York to open the Spotted Pig. We visited just after the venue lost the Michelin star it had held since 2005, being downgraded to the Bib Gourmand guide. Nevertheless the achievement of this venue cannot be understated, to hold a star as a gastropub is to say the venue could compete with the finest of restaurants around the world while still being accessible and affordable to many.The space is small but it adds to the atmosphere. The decor is eclectic, warm and cheerful with a friendly and welcoming buzz as you enter. We visited on a weekend and gained the brunch options as well as the usual lunch choices. ...

  The Spotted Pig is a Michelin starred pub
Deviled Eggs: a reference in the house. A tart, almost pickled flavor to the filling with a definite hit of mustard heat, light and fresh. Hidden crystals of salt crackle between the teeth.
Devils on Horseback: bacon wrapped dates that were the perfect blend of sweet and savory. The bacon was melt in the mouth and was complemented by the sweetness of the dates. The sauce tied it all together very nicely and interestingly. Definitely a dish worth trying.
Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestring Fries: This is a must try. The burger is simple, just with blue cheese and soft grilled bun the meat, it melted in the mouth, bursting with flavor. The shoestring fries with garlic and rosemary that came with it were a triumph all on their own. The burger is, even so, over hyped and priced.

  The Spotted Pig is a Michelin-starred ?gastro pub?, reputedly British in style, and apparently ? if top search engine results are to be believed ? where certain celebrities hang out (and where numpty celebrity-stalkers go to try and see numpty celebrities. All this numpty celebrity stuff put me off. Who cares? really?).

We happened to be passing The Spotted Pig anyway, and it looks so appealing and small and befitting its local community with all the pussy-willows and plants and pig decorations outside (a bit like your local flower shop) that we just had to step inside to check it out. Enjoying the friendly bar service as well as the appealing pig-themed interior with funky food fabric stools (bacon patterns, pepper prints, etc) we decided to have a late lunch at the bar after all? ...

  I didn?t think that British food and yummy could be used in a sentence together until I went to the Spotted Pig.

April Bloomfield is the super talented chef behind the deliciousness of this gastro pub. The popularity of the Spotted Pig has started a whole trend of people milling towards gastro pubs in the city.

This little bohemian spot in the West Village offers seasonal British and Italian dishes on its menu, which are adapted from popular pub food. Just try their killer Gnudi, which are these ?to die for? dumplings made with sheep?s milk ricotta. Their deviled eggs are divine as is their outstanding Banoffee pie for dessert.

 

The Spotted Pig is just one of those places that you cannot get enough off. I think I can safely say?that I?m hooked!!

  Can't go past a blue cheese burger and shoestring fries!

Not the easiest place to get to, but had to go try it out. The burger can get a bit try due to the large bun. Shoestring is probably the wrong description, it's more like spaghetti fries and you'll be amazed at how much of it you can eat.

  Heard great reviews about the burger so we went there to try. Liked the first impression when I stepped into the restaurant. It is a cosy English pub with small and big piggy decor.

  We waited for over 2 hours, because of that I thought the burger was slightly overrated (wish it wasn't Roquefort cheese). Fries looked awesome but we're so thin they were kind of hard to eat. Great presentation and vibe though. Must go at least once.

  Heads up their cloacas. Being inflexible doesn't make you cool - it makes you jerks.

   Small Yet Big on taste. It's kind of tight quarters in this restaurant upstairs and downstairs. We sat by the window for for drinks and bites and people watching.

It has been a while since I wanted to try: I heard many people talking about this place and about what is supposed to be an outstanding burger! You do not need to tell me that twice to have a restaurant in my radar! The place has its charm with a bunch of piggies all over the place! There is even a frame that reminded me of the movie Delicatessen! From outside, it gives a feel of a house in the country, with all the plants. Not only can you see pigs from outside, but they are everywhere inside, giving a playful feel to the warm decor. With a name like The Spotted Pig, you could imagine that the restaurant is all about the edible parts of this animal, but as you will see, it is not the case. In fact, all drawings and photos are not only about pigs, although they are the majority. So we went on a Saturday and decided to show up for brunch at 11:30am, fearing that, with no reservation, we would have a problem to get a table. Yes, this re ...

   Eh, I wasnt impressed.. I heard great things about the burger at this place so I wanted to try it. In short not great and not terrible. The worst part about it was the wait. I had the deviled eggs appetizer and they were overpriced, $4.00 for 2 halves (1whole egg) and did not taste good to me. I waited 45 minutes for a table and the burger was simply OK. The fries were very salty and I like salty food but that was ridiculous. I probably wont go back.

   Never again. I have eaten in really great restaurants and tasted beautiful food and trust me this place will not fall into either category. When we arrived the place was packed and to say it was loud is an understatement. The wait was an hour. We pushed an shoved our way to the bar and after 15 minutes the bartender finally took our order. The wine selection was terrible and expensive. We couldn't hear each other talk our hear ourselves think for that matter. After we finally got a table which was crammed next to two other tables we saw the menu that lacked choice and explanation. I ordered the $17 burger medium and it came rare. I mean really really rare. I asked our server and he just blew it off saying that their medium is a proper rare.The appetizer sucked it was a bowl of olives in oil and the water was hot. I couldn't wait to leave.

the food is good and definitely met the expectation... but i wasn't ""wow'ed""... to their credit, not many places, including NYC, would be so bold to serve ox tongues, calf livers, burgers with blue cheese, and gnudis on their menu... all of which are very well executed... a bit disappointed at the flourless chocolate cake but the house beer definitely made up for it.

This place is so unique and clever and establishment for locals. Went for brunch on Sunday- maximizing our chances to get a seat- fabulous french toast.

   Amazing!!! The hype is deserved. I went 2 nights ago with a co-worker. I wasn't sure if the place was worth a 30-40 minute wait, but once my food arrived, I realized I might have waited for up to an hour for my dinner. We had the :
Chicken Liver Toast--Outstanding! The onions melted away to nothing, the flavors were just right, and the bread was soft yet crusty.
Devils on Horseback--Poached pears wrapped in prunes wrapped in bacon...sweet, spicy, and savory all at once.
Stuffed Pig's Eat--My dinner. I'm from the south; nothing pork scares me and I'm so glad I ordered this. Stuffed with sweetbreads, it was a fantastic dish. Don't be scared!
The Spotted Pig Burger--My coworkers dinner. The burger was outstanding but the FRIES. . .OMG the Fries!!! Shoestring fries fried with garlic and tossed with Thyme?!?!?
Fresh organic Cherries on ice for dessert.

   'Gastropub' Gone WILD!. Yep. Spotted Pig is a GGW. Mind you, in a good way.

I first ate at SP when they opened to massive acclaim, causing seismic shifting in ocean currents and me to wait at their tiny bar, getting hammered, while waiting for an even smaller table.

Ask to be sat upstairs, in one of the corner booths. It's romantic, private and sorta sexy in that 'I Haven't Bathed For Weeks' sorta Village way.

Service is always stellar at The Pig. Great bartenders too. They work in utter chaos, so how they can remember you and pour drinks so darned fast is beyond my comprehension. Kudos.

Yes, their burger is a revelation, but try something else. Scour the menu for interest and detail. Don't just plop down and go with the crowds of Zagat-laden tourists who line up for red meat nirvana...

Oh yeah. Pig's got the best truffle fries EVER.",26-Feb-10,BN

   Worthy of it's one star for the great service, charming decor, and excellent food. We went there for Sunday brunch only to discover they were out of the Dutch baby pancakes. Instead we had the French toast with bananas and borboun sauce and the griddle hash with poached eggs. Both were excellent. The toast was thick and fluffy and just the perfect sweetness. The griddle hash was made with beef in a rich sauce. The poached eggs were definitely farm fresh and done perfectly.

   Never disappointing. For such a trendy place, you'd think the food would be a letdown.

  The oldest steakhouse still operating in New York. Everything is ala carte. Shared a dinner for 2 and it was light on the sides, but very generous with the melt in your mouth filets. Glad we shared a salad also. It did get a little loud for a good conversation so we did not linger for long. Parking in the area is expensive, but you are in NYC so you should expect that.

   Satisfying. Grade: B+

Old Homestead does a good job with the standards of the steakhouse, adding its own mark and identity. The sirloin was seasoned nicely and cooked perfectly. The Kobe beef burger was huge and very good, and not overly rich. The creamed spinach was very flavorful but bit rich, so I couldn't enjoy as much as I'd wanted. Old Homestead's hash brown was crispy but not dripping with butter - excellent. As for seafood dishes, their shrimp stuffed with crabmeat was wonderful, and the sea bass was beautifully prepared, seared nicely and not at all dry. All in all, a wonderful meal.",28-May-13,Mark

  i've been there twice, and i've been two more posh steakhouses in NYC. I really liked this one: The price is quite expansive honestly, so be ready to pay a bit a lot. But if you have at least 100-110 bucks per person to spend for a unique dinner experience, just go there and ask the waiter to help you order. The rest is happiness.",4-Oct-15,Ali

   Untrustworthy. Been several times and the steak is amazing. BUT, on our last visit on New Years Eve, the restaurant seemed to be running a scam with regards to its wine list. We ordered a $44 bottle from the menu with the sommelier. When we received the bill, the same wine came out to $62. When I asked our waiter about it, he said it was a computer issue and corrected the mistake. But it was New Years and I doubt most people would pay close enough attention to the bill to catch it. The service was also exceptionally bad (although most of the staff was simply standing around, we had to ask repeatedly for bread and drink refills). I love the steak here, but I'm not sure I would go back after this very bad experience.",4-Jan-11,Davepl99

   Overpriced / Tenderized. Overpriced for what they serve. Who needs to tenderize a rib eye? The service was good considering the volume of customers our server had to handle. The appetizer of east/west coast oysters and king crab was so-so, the west coast oysters were miniscule. If the meat inside the oyster does not fill up a small oyster fork the kitchen should replace it with a more sizeable oyster, especially if one is paying $4 per piece. The king crab was served cold and didn't have much flavor. The entree arrived and I had to send it back once because the rib-eye was overdone.

  Read the reviews so thought we would check this please out.

Having never visited NYC before we didn't know what to expect and initially were disappointed as it's a fast food outlet in the busy station terminal. However the freshly prepared burgers and fries along with amazing shakes completely made up for it. They were incredibly tasty and not dripping in fat. We had to wait with a buzzer so we knew they had prepared for us and they weren't just sat waiting.

Totally recommend, 2 burgers, 2 fries (1 with bacon/cheese/BBQ sauce) and 2 shakes came in at $35 so not too expensive either",5 months ago,Prat Usha

  First timer! Wait from end of the line to food in hand was about 40 minutes. You can order a drink or shake in the separate window and get back in line though which is considerate of the shack. I ordered a double shack burger, fries, and a vanilla shake. The burger was on point; it was cooked medium rare and was very juicy. I could really taste the flavor of the quality beef! The bun was also quite exceptional. The crinkle cut fries are in a world of its own, in both texture as well as flavor! The shake though was lacking..

  ""... And then it hit me?I felt ... the taste [of Shake Shack burgers] was committee-designed, focus-grouped, and market-tested to the extreme before being made available to the public. Not that there's anything wrong with making sure you have a great product before selling it. Though the burgers possess all of my favorite food properties?salty, savory, sweet, spicy, smoky?they seem universally devoid of one of the most important quality: soul.

  These are, by far, the best burgers in the World. I mean it. I've traveled all over, and I always have burgers whenever I can (simply because it's my measuring tape for good food!). EVERYTHING about a Shake Shack burger is done perfectly. Ingredients are fresh and great, the flavor is amazing, the sides are incredible, even the lemonade is fantastic.

True story: I stood in the rain at almost 11 PM (closing time) on a saturday night in August 2014, just to get a burger. There were rats and roaches running around me.

  The line seemed promising. If that many people are waiting, it must be for something good. Good, but not great. First of all, a grilled portobello is not a proper ""veggie"" burger.

   Amazing!. We were expecting a huge line up and a long wait time, but we ordered and picked up our burgers in less than 15 minutes. I ordered the Double Shack Burger with fries and coke and wow the burger was legit!! The patty was very juicy and flavorful. I liked how the burger was very simple without a whole bunch of extra condiments because it focused on the taste of the beef. Even the fries were just as delicious. It's too bad they don't have a Shake Shack here in Toronto.

   A Great NY burger. The Madison Square Park location is my favorite compared to the other NY locations mostly due to the feel and scenery. Nevertheless, the product is the same either way.

The place offer a 4oz proprietary blend of premium beef burger topped with tomato, lettuce, ShackSauce, and American cheese, on a grilled potato bun. Apart from that dogs, fries, and custards. The Place at Madison Square Park I went with The Chief, the queue wasn't so bad even though it was an amazing day. The queue is so long that you can see it from the website thanks to the Shack Cam to decide the best time to drop by. Mer Shack dise I ordered the Shack Burger, fries, and a dog. The burger is perfect for purist, an American classic, the beef is spot on, the juices, the flavour, the balance, Shake is like the old testament for American burgers. The dog was good, nice flavour, good touch with the kraut, finally fries were perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside, s ...

I'm sure many foodies on this site can relate when I say that I did A LOT of research to plan out where to eat during my recent trip to NYC. Shake Shack went on my list as a definite place to check out. as I read they had good burgers that could be compared to In-N-Out (boy, do I miss those burgers).

So there I was, waiting patiently for 20 minutes at 9:30pm. Between my friend and I, we ordered 3 Shackburgers, a peanut butter shake and cheese fries.


BURGERS: I found them lacking in flavour and had to slab on more ketchup to compensate for the missing taste.

SHAKE: Nothing to phone home about. It was damn thick though and hard to drink.

CHEESE FRIES: Best part of the meal. The cheese lays on the fries more dry than wet and saucy which I liked.

   Micky's Review. Glad I tried one of the original locations - cute location in the park, gives a very European feel. The ordering/line system works well if you know what you are doing. My mushroom burger was tasty and not too overly fried like other places. Prefer it over Good Stuff Eatery's in DC. Enjoyed the cheese fries and liked that they served beer and wine too. More shake flavors than at the stall in Nationals' park, but that is to be expected for the full service shack.

   Not Worth The Wait. We heard about how wonderful it was and told to expect a wait, things can be worth the wait. After a 1/2 hour of waiting and getting to experience the shake shack cheeseburger, fries, and choco shake I wished I had skipped the wait and went to Five Guys instead....

It was not good or worth the wait. The burger was small and lacked the flavor, my wife's was under cooked, and the shake seemed like a thicker version McDonalds choc shake.

Sorry, the word of mouth and line don't match the quality or the flavor expected.

   Great Burger, Friendly Staff. My husband and I went here the other night just before closing. We had NO wait! It was amazing. I had anticipated long lines, but we must have chosen a good time to go. The staff was friendly & the food was decent. The burgers were amazing--soft homemade style bun, tender juicy burger with toppings of your choice. The burger is kind of small though...so IF you have a big appetite--get more than a single. We got a chocolate shake...expensive, but heavenly. It was so creamy & very chocolately. The fries were a disappointment. They were hard and seemed like freezer fries. I would pass on them. The outdoor dining atmosphere in the park was delightful, especially at night with the white twinkle lites all lit up.

   Absolutely Delisioso. Always went there at least twice a week with my boyfriend to munch on their amazing burgers and scrumptious cheese fries. Made it a routine, even.

   Am I missing something?. I've worked next to this place for years and finally caved in a few months ago. Here are my thoughts on this place...

The line. It looks intimidating but moves somewhat quickly which is good for us cubicle jockeys.

The fries. Really good - I mean REALLY good!

The burgers. This is where I am stumped. I've ordered burgers from here on three separate occasions and each time they were too greasy and the bun was not the freshest. In reality it was as if I was biting into a pile of goo. Not impressed.",19-Aug-10,ENB

   Cool Setting - Great Burgers!!. If you are after a wonderfull burger and fries, you can't go wrong stopping at this place.

Set in Madison Square Park, you eat at tables in the fresh air amongst the trees.

It is a very popular place and lines at the ordering window may seem long but don't be discouraged...it moves quickly and your order will be ready at the pick up window sooner than you think.

Then find a table and enjoy the great food.

Recommend getting there at twilight when the the lights are on...wonderful setting.",12-May-10,Tony C

Would I stand in line - 45 minutes - as per Shake Shack at Madison Square - for the ShackBurger - no way - good but not ""to-die-for"" greatness - even though the social scene - will be - UWS scene-n-a-half

Bottom line - Shake Shack ain't Pinks -

  EM is a Montreal based Greek restaurant with a very strong NYC following.

  Not up to the the 5 star standard of the Montreal and Las Vegas branches. The food is still mostly excellent with a few notable exceptions: The kefalotiri cheese in the Milos Special (fried zucchini appetizer) was cold and hard (ok it's not a soft cheese but cold it had as much attitude as the very sullen maitre'd ) The spaghetti was so overcooked with the accompanying (perfectly prepared ) lobster it reminded me of canned pasta from my abusive childhood although admittedly with a far superior sauce. All of this could have been forgiven were it not for the abysmal service provided by our very friendly and very inattentive waiter. We also didn't appreciate the nearly 3lb lobster he chose for us without any discussion . A lobster half the size (and price) would have suited us fine. Over all for $300 for two with a couple of glasses of wine each we expected more.",25-Jun-16,Kosherish Dave

  Perfectly immaculate.

The meal, the service, the fish, the potatoes, the attention to every detail is unparalleled. The price was off the wall. $120 per person with almost no alcohol, no coffee and no dessert was painful, so one has to deduct 1/2 a point. If the price is no obstacle, then you cannot be better served any better meal.

   Reasonable Price Fix Lunch. $25, choice of 6 or so apps and 8 mains. Yes, a couple of each had an upcharge, and a steep upcharge ($10). But the food was nice and fresh, delicious tomatoes in the middle of winter in a pretty place. And you can get out of there for a reasonable price if you want.

   Don't get ripped off. Fish basically a bland food, tastes like cardboard. You've got to do somethng to it to get flavor. Here, they add olive oil and lemon.and.... nothing! Or I should say a very high price nothing. Our ballata fish was about $50/lb for a 3 pound fish. We (4 of us) got about 5 ounces each and the same amount from a black sea bass, @$34/lb.The appetizers were excellent. The fried zuchini chips and cheese was superb as were the shrimp. The carbonated water is, are you ready?, nine bucks a bottle.

   TERRIBLE SERVICE. My wife and I live in Bay Ridge and dine out in the neighborhood often. We were looking forward to checking out the newly expanded Cebu. We arrived early for dinner and were seated in the back room. After about ten minutes I stepped into the bar and asked a busboy if the waiter was aware that we were in the back (we were the only ones in the room). He said that he would let the waiter know. The waitress came to the table about five minutes later. She was rude. When we got the bill we had been charged double for a drink. When I pointed it out, she brought it back to the bar and blamed the mistake on a faulty computer. We will not be going back to Cebu.",15-Nov-09,Neil

   Opps. Four friends went to dinner there the other day, not only did we feel rushed, but when we finished our dinner and asked to have another round, we were told we had to leave that they needed the table. There were three empty tables next to us. Then to add insult to evening they tacked on a 20% gratuity, which is usually done with parties of 6 or 8 at all restuarants. It will be a very long time before I dine there again.

The dimly-lit dining room at Minetta Tavern , while terrible for food photography, is one of the most buzzy, atmospheric ones I've eaten in. And I've eaten in a lot. I kicked off with a generous portion of roasted bone marrow served with shallot confit and baguette soldiers while my friend went with roast baby beets . Both got the thumbs up.

   Serious Wine List. The food here is very good and the wine list requires quite an education to sort through. Luckily, they have a sommelier to help.

That matters a lot. The first bottle of Burgundy I ordered was corked, but I only know that because I asked the sommelier about it after seeing him open it and then leave it at the bus station to go get another. I'm sure he would have discreetly let it pass unmentioned otherwise. You couldn't ask for better service.",5-Jan-10,LB

  The Smith is one of the more popular of the generation of NYC restaurants that evolved out of the speakeasy scene. Lots of cocktails and lots of wood contrast with the industrial lamps and white tile walls. It's like eating on a renovated subway platform from the 1940s. The place, at 7 on a weekend, was crowded, but not such that I wasn't able to get a reservation or find a spot at the bar to wait for my friends. It's a little loud and the food is standard American comfort food, by and large. Burgers, pot pie, mac and cheese - standard gastropub; no groundbreaking menus here - so maybe it shouldn't be a shock that there were a fair number of kids. I guess that if mom and dad want a drink, and the kids want a burger, and nobody wants boring, The Smith is a pretty good choice. ...

   Brings back fond memories of childhood. Since I was four, 20 years ago, I have been coming to this place. The walls used to be lined with hundreds of wooden pink pigs on a ledge. Since then the place has undergone some changes to give it more appeal, but the food has not. The scallion pancakes appetizer here is bar none the best I have ever had and that has not changed. The Szechwan dumplings are a spicy delight. The general tso's chicken, the three glass chicken, the firecracker shrimp, the peking duck, the wonton soup are all spectacular.

   I am not coming back... Not worth the money.

the line was too long, the place was too small, we couldnt find a place to sit. The meals are overpriced. and a bucket of 6 pcs of chicken was for how much???

Just because I wanted to taste what I've always had back home, i tried it and took it back to our place. The Palabok didnt have much taste to it besides just being way too salty. I've had better chicken at a really bad chicken place with their chicken joy, sauce was very similar to what they serve back in the Philippines though.

I just wouldnt recomment THIS PLACE and I WILL NOT BE BACK, I heard from some of my friends that the one in NJ and in California taste much better than this location. So if you're reading this go there instead. LOL",5-Jul-12,Techie

  We have had many, many meals at Trattoria over the last 25 years.  Never a bad meal, never a just-OK meal, always great food and great service!  Word of advice:  the cannolis are addictive!  Wine list is extensive, waiters are knowledgeable, the ambiance is great and food always wonderful.  In the summer time one can sit outside and enjoy a cool, crisp drink.  During your meal don't be surprised if waiters come around with complimentary fresh out-of-the-oven chocolate chip cookies.    They are also great for parties and have a separate party room downstairs for larger parties.

   Ok, but for a type. I thought that New York had grown out of the stereotypical Italian restaurant where meatballs, parmigiana and cannoli featured heavily, especially in midtown and at this price range. Instead I discovered it has not. Trattoria dell'Arte is just such a place. Food is well prepared and efficiently ordered in a well rehearsed sort of way. The atmosphere is lively given the large full dining room. But the menu is uninspiring and a bit stale reminiscent of successful Italian restaurants of past.

   We had the most fabulous Italian meal last night in NYC at Trattoria Dell'Arte. Soooo good. The almond crust cannoli made a grown man in our party cry, and the ice cream torta made a woman in our party cry. Sausage and peppers, meatballs, various seafood and vegetable antipasti appetizers, the wine, the waiter, all fabulous. Gigantic rustic thin-crust pizzas. Great meats and sauces. And they took us, a surprise party of 7, in as walk-ins on a busy Saturday night and seated us promptly and with humor. They did twice forget or bring the wrong dishes, but we didn't mind, everyone was in such good spirits, and the things they did bring by mistake ended up being awesome as well.

  Locanda Verde is Robert De Niro?s comeback restaurant after the dismal failure of Ago, which formerly occupied this space.

This ?Green Inn?, is Andrew Carmellini?s newest undertaking, where he has created a seasonal market leaning menu. Unlike his previous acts at Café Boulud and A Voce, Locanda Verde is a simpler Italian tavern with home-style dishes.

Carmellini?s kitchen turns out knockout food without much fuss. Just try their sheep?s-milk ricotta or the lamb meatball sliders. Any dish that involves bread is a winner (try the crostini) and the desserts are decadent delights too.

It?s no wonder that Locanda Verde is being hailed as one of the hottest new restaurants in Tribeca.

All three are open at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow, with their always appealing brunch menus. For a similarly high-quality NYC New Years Day brunch experience, I'd also recommend any of Daniel Holzman and Michael Chernow's Meatball Shops, including the newish one on the Upper East Side.

   Total comfort food!. This place has a great vibe. It's cozy and comfortable and situated on corner so it's wrapped in windows. As a solo diner, the bartender did a great job of making me feel at home without being ""too present.""

Fried artichoke - The flavors were good, but it's probably not something I would order again.

  A Tribeca Winner!. An upscale restaurant with affordable prices specializing in Italian favorites that you will have a hard time deciding what dish from the menu you will eventually order. Their pastas are excellent, and you cannot go wrong with their stuffed ravioli with short rib and pork in an arrabiata type sauce. They also have a well thought out wine list to choose from.

   This meal was the best I have had in years. Rarely do I order four courses and clean the plate on each one. The foccacia was peasant style and simply delicious. From there it was the Blue Crab Jalapeno crostini - 'scusa I'm not Italian - antipasto was Tomato Watermelon Smoky Feta cheese delight - for Primi I selected the GIGATONI - giant size rigatoni with brazed short rib and pork ragout - btw the wife had Grandma's Ravioli which was fresh and light with a strong flavor or garden fresh tomatoe. Secondi was Halibut wrapped in Prosciutto and it was both flavorful and light. Everything was so good I could not resist dessert - capuccino and Pistachio Butter Cake with Pistacchio gelato.

John the bar tender and Alex our server were very attentive, great service no rush and delicious food. The fried calamari was perfect. I had the Frutti Di Mare, my wife had the Rotini Rugantini both cooked perfectly. Salad and bread delicious. Reminded me of the way my Mother and aunts cooked. The house red wine was great too.

  Cafeteria is a restaurant that I like for brunch over the weekends. Their stack of silver dollar pancakes with berries and whipped cream is toothsome and what makes me choose this restaurant over others. I like bacon on the side to balance out the flavors. The lemon ricotta pancakes are also excellent. Avocado toast is ubiquitous everywhere and so simple to make at home but how many people cook nowadays? At Cafeteria, it is presented as an avocado toast Benedict which is mucho fancy compared to the far simpler version given at other places.

It appeared that this particular concoction used a smaller amount of horseradish, though more finely chopped than I usually find. While this slightly allayed my spice burn fears, I was still concerned about the effects of the infused jalapeño....Upon my first sip, however, I found the Inferno Bloody Mary to be, well, lacking an inferno.

   OK but will not be back. Decent enough food but I found the waitstaff behaviour to be a bit sketchy. I had two items added to my tab after I handed over my credit card. I didn't sign until they removed the items. I guess they figured I was a tourist rube who wouldn't be checking the charges.
I frankly don't put up with crap like this. Either the management knows about this kind of stuff and allows it or they don't in which case they are idiots.

   Good Food, Fraudulent Charges. It's a mixed bag. The food is good and the scene vibrant, but the chaos has its downside, too. More than once, I've had items on my check that were never ordered or served. The last time, it was $60 from the bar, when we ordered nothing from the bar at all. My fault for signing the credit card receipt, but theirs for adding the items and not catching it when the bill was presented. Management refused even to split the difference and then lied, saying it was impossible to refund anything to the card. I'll never eat there again.

The food is also for the most part very average, however their macaroni is definitely in the top 5 in NYC.

   My go-to place. I am a cafeteria fan.
You CANNOT beat the VEGAN veggie burger for only $10!!
Plus the lychee bellini is amazing. (the drinks always cost more than the food! But well worth a try.)

Cafeteria is much better after 9:30pm...when the cooler crowd comes in. After 11pm is even hipper...then once you get the 2am after-club hopping crowd--its quite the fun experience.

I love cafeteria. It just makes me happy. Even the takeout is worth it...well FOR MY VEGAN VEGGIE BURGER ADDICTION!

   The British Are Coming!. Great place for latenight eating: It's typical British pub grub with healthy twists.

   Small trendy restaurant with nice and attentive staff. Radish is not only in the name, alot of the dishes we sampled had radish incorporated. The hummus appetizer was large and delicious with bread and fried radish chips. I had the special; which was pork shoulder and it was so tender. Good wine selection.

  I had the misfortune of falling for Nobu's notorious P.R. hype. From all the puffery, one would think this restaurant is the second coming of Sukiyabashi Jiro. Well, perhaps the second coming of Panda Express, but anything better would be a large stretch of the culinary imagination.

I'm so disappointed with Nobu that I'm not going to waste words or time on this review. Suffice it to say that I found the quality of the fish lacking. The chefs here don't even have the good sense of someone such as Seki from Sushi Seki to disguise the lack of freshness.

The pretentious snobbery here is ridiculous. Note to servers, I may not be Robert DeNiro (this restaurant's co-founder), but last time I checked my money is as good as his. So when you see non-celebrity patrons waiting extended periods for service, it might be wise to do your job and help them... minus the attitude.",22-Sep-15,Evan

Having opened in 1994 the restaurant has been a pioneer in Asian-fusion cuisine, particularly in the now widespread Japanese-Peruvian style of cooking, and has spread to include over twenty locations worldwide. With investors such as restaurateur Drew Nieporent (of Tribeca Grill, Corton, and Centrico) and actor Robert De Niro (who first became acquainted with Chef Matsuhisa at his Matsuhisa restaurant in LA), Nobu's success was almost guaranteed from the beginning. Seventeen years later the restaurant still ranks among New York's finest; and while it might not be as trendy as it once was, Nobu Tribeca still retains both its allure and popularity. The design of the restaurant is meant to evoke the tranquility of the Japanese countryside. Earth tone paints, wooden columns in the shape of trees, and natural wood tables make for a much less modern ...

The surroundings are amazing. The waiter is so friendly and polite, I want to bring him back to Melbourne Nobu. I ask for a beef wagyu dish similar to the one in Melbourne - the waiter doesn't know what it is - so he says he will call Melbourne and ask - right now! I decline profusely, saying it's not that important, waiter insists it is no trouble. He returns shortly, advising us that the wagyu beef dish is being prepared as we speak - to the Melbourne recipe.

   # 1 Japenese in NYC. Aside from the original Matsuhisa on La Cienaga in Los Angeles, I have been to two on Hudson in New York City--Nobu New York City and Nobu Next Door.In typical Japanese sushi bar fashion, the best way to experience the entrees is to order omakase (omakase means trust in Japanese), entrusting your taste buds to the chef. The dishes are designed to come out from cold to hot with a sushi sampler arriving last followed by dessert. My favorites are: black cod with miso, yellowtail with jalapeno, rock shrimp tempura with ponzu (the creamy spicy sauce lacks kick), wagyu beef, Arctic charr with crispy baby spinach, and the sashimi salad. As for service, it is impeccable. The servers are courteous, discreet, and nothing but smiles. I never feel rushed and they do not act like idiots when celebrities or VIPs enter the premises.",9-Jan-09,Mark Kasco

   Not so great.. Went for a Sunday brunch. It was packed so I understand that seating is limited but I had reservations, and still had to wait almost 30 minutes. Then we were seated at the back in the corner, squashed between other tables. Very uncomfortable.
Food was mediocre, at best. Bread basket seemed stale.
Service wasn't bad, but there are way better cafés/restos for a Sunday brunch/lunch in the area....considering it's Central Park West area...I was disappointed with the quality. Cappuccinos were the only decent thing I had there (but seriously how hard are those to make)",31-Jan-11,TOnNYC

   Regular post Met eatery. We really love dinning here after the opera. Fiorello offers a great antipasto menu. We always get a mix of veggies. Just great. This time we also ordered the scallop & shrimp salad. While it was good, they did not remove the abductor from the scallops, which is a bit tough to eat.

   Huge portions!. The 1/2 portions are much more than enough for a luncheon portion. The vegetarian salad is very, very fresh: iceberg lettuce, slices of orange, artichoke hearts, mushrooms topped with a light vinaigrette.

   How could it be so good?. I totally assumed that this would be a tourist trap, since it's situated right across from Lincoln Center with its sidewalk cafe always crowded. Well you can definitely spend a LOT of money there if you want. But it's well spent. You can also have a selection of three absolutely delicious appetizers for $15. Not a bad deal even at dinner. Except that once you see the appetizers (sorry - they are called something else. Not tapas, because this is Italian) you want to have more, and to include some of the ones containing fish. My favorites - caramelized fennel, bufalo mozzerelo, swiss chard with pine nuts, grilled octopus, beets with oranges, grilled veggies, calamari salad, smoked salmon rolls wrapped in cucumber. We have gone there more often than I would have thought, and walked away paying between $35 and $140 for two.",17-Sep-09,Ann Vachon

   Love this place. Awesome mix of Euro transplants, ladies who lunch, neighborhood moguls, and hedge fund managers. No reservations. Arrive for lunch at noon; at 12:15 the French maitre d' will look at the empty tables, look back at you, and say ""I do not have it!"" It's all part of the ambience; the perfect amount of snob appeal backed up with great wine, great bistro food (cajun chicken is the 'go to' order here), and a great scene.

  I've had Candle 79 bookmarked for over two years and it was worth the wait! I loved the causal feel yet of this restaurant. The restaurant was a bit dark inside, definitely a place where you can enjoy a dinner date, it wasn't loud, and there wasn't a lot of people when I went with a friend mid-week for dinner. The patrons were a mix of late 30s to 50s so it was a good mix of people. It didn't feel at all pretentious despite being in UES. The staff was friendly and helpful with helping us decide what to order. I tried the crepe which was amazing. Everything came well together. Portions were perfect. We ended up eating our entire plate and had no room to share. It says a lot that they wowed a non-vegan friend with their spaghetti and meatballs. Their food is tasty. I would highly recommend it.

  Kat's Deli has a school cafeteria feel to it.  It is big with many tables . It has titled floors.  We walked up to the area that looks like the meat section in a grocery store. Their food offerings are fairly simple.  Kat?s is very well known though.  Many people are going there for the quality of food.  I ordered a pastrami sandwich on rye.  It was a big sandwich especially for a big city.  The price was about on par with what I?d expect from city restaurants. But, oh boy, was it delicious. I?d eat there every day if I could. It doesn?t seem like the cleanest place.  It is well light especially for being there at night.  The corwd wasn?t so bad.  As I said the place is big and I handle myself well being in crowds.  This place is not for people who want to sit and relax.  There?s plenty of people around.  In New York, you are bound to meet some interesting characters.",22 days ago,Mary Klein

  The best sandwich I have had!! The deli is a relic, it has a canteen style dining hall with walls covered in pictures of all the celebrities that have graced it's doors. This is where that scene in ""Where Harry met Sally"" was shot. ""I'll have what she's having"". It has been family run for over 100 years!
The choices are extensive and a little pricey but it's all worth it.
The meat is magical and truly melts in your mouth. Here is why;
""Our corned beef and pastrami is cured using a slower method, which best flavors the meat, without injecting chemicals, water, or other additives to speed the process. Our finished product can take up to a full 30 days to cure, while commercially prepared corned beef is often pressure-injected (or ?pumped?) to cure in 36 hours. Yep, you read that right. 30 days vs. 36 hours.""
A must if you are in NY.

  It was our last day in New York city when we visited this iconic place for lunch. You can't come to New York and not taste the famous Pastrami Sandwich at Katz's. We had a Pastrami sandwich and the corned beef one with some fries and pickles. It's a self service restaurant as you will be handled some sort of coupons upon entry then when you go to the counter and ask for what you want they write down on the same coupons what was your order. While leaving you deliver the coupons to the cashier and pay your bill. Being a meat lover I loved both sandwiches and I can say the place was up to my expectations.

  Katz is well known and a landmark and people should check it out. However, it is very very crowded and one could find themselves standing in line to get in.

  Very busy during lunch hour, but absolutely worth waiting in the line. Plenty of stands offering classic pastrami sandwich which is fair enough for a couple. In case you are really starving, order the whole portion. We skipped fries on side, as well as the melted cheese - that would be to heavy for an early afternoon snack. Classic mustard and pickles are offered free of charge. Meat was great - smooth, well cooked and very tasty. I also liked the classic bread and cucumbers.

Reubens aren't that common in Sydney or Melbourne, and when you find one, it's a timid imitation of the behemoth we had at Katz's. The meat, the pickles, the sauerkraut.

  Have heard great things about Katz so we decided to check it out during our trip to NYC. When we got there a staff told us where to order. Their ordering system is a little confusing but we pretty much caught on. When we got to the counter we ordered a corned beef and a pastrami sandwich to go. During our wait we were served samples of the meat we chose. My goodness the sandwiches were ginormous! One sandwich is probably good for 2 people. Sandwiches are about $20 each but worth it. We ate them when we got back to our hotel and it was still warm and delish. I had to save one half for later and it was just as good. The pickles and cucumbers add an extra touch. Definitely will go back!",28-Aug-16,604fOOdie

  Famous Dave took us the Famous Katz - and as expected there were six queues for the pastrami sandwiches- which would've taken far too long to include in our food tour. But Dave suggested we try the garlic sausage hot dog on baked bread, and it was delicious- we especially loved the mustard.

  If it wasn't for the incredibly confusing and chaotic ordering process, I would have given this place a much higher rating. We tried the pastrami sandwich on rye. It was pretty steep at $20 but the portion was big enough to almost feed two. The meat was super tender and the mustard spread made a great pairing.
With that said, I honestly don't understand why they can't hire a better door person who can just quickly explain how the ordering works. 
Basically, once you walk in, you will get a blank ticket. Then you go up to the counters marked ""for ordering sandwiches"" and make your order. The sandwich maker will then bring out a plate with a couple slices of meat for you to taste while he assembles the sandwhich. Then he asks for your ticket to write the price of your order on it. You then go and eat at any of the ""non-waited"" tables and pay at the door when you leave by showing them your ticket.

  Of course it's a little dirty and the door staff are gruff - that adds to the experience. Sometimes the counter guys are in a mood and will yell at you - others are exceptionally nice. The food is pricey but it's totally worth it. My tip would be to get yourself a  sandwich and try to eat that before ordering more food like a knish or fries. I have made the mistake of getting a sandwich and fries all at once and after my sandwich realizing I can't touch anything else. Getting just a sandwich will fill you up and keep your bill manageable.

  What an experience!! Best atmosphere and the pastrami sandwich is to die for! It's huge so share with a partner! The highlight for me was the matzo ball soup! The chicken stock in the soup was so yummy and the matzo ball was the perfect texture and soaked up the soup PERFECTLY! It took around 15 -20 minutes to be served but you're watching everything around you the time goes so fast and they give you a slice of pastrami while you wait! I'll be back first thing when i'm in NYC!!! It's a must.

  When we started telling people about our New York holiday, we were inundated with recommendations for places to eat. Everyone who?s been there has their favourites, and are very passionate about them. My list became so long and unmanageable that I scrapped it ? twice ? and in the end just decided to work it out it when we arrived, on the assumption that there would be probably be plenty of great places wherever we ended up. One of the reasons it?s taken me so long to start work documenting our trip is that there?s just so much to tell. ...

  After watching so many TV shows that featured this deli I decided to venture downtown to give it a go. It was quite busy which is the norm as I am told. Three of us sat in the ""table service"" side of the restaurant and I had the matzo ball soup with a half brisket sandwich.

  Overpriced tourist trap.

I went there on a reco from friends and paid about $15 USD for a simple pastrami on rye - no fries, no drink, nothing else.

I've had better here in Toronto (Centre St. Deli) and in Montreal (Schwartz) so it's hard for me to give this more than a 3.5 in terms of value for money.

The sandwich was good but this is a tourist trap through and through. I'm not entirely familiar with the NYC area but I'd look around.

  Absolutely the best sandwich. Not just pastrami, the best sandwich period.
I've been here lots of time at different times of the year and different hours. The quality of the pastrami has always been the same. That is the primarily characteristic of a good restaurant. The fact that you can rely on the fact that what you once had, you will have the same thing every time.
I hear great thing about most the food, but I've only has the corned beef and the pastrami. Not a great fan of the corned beef in general, but the pastrami is off the hook. You can have it mixed with the beef, add swiss cheese, chop liver or whatever.

  This is quite a legendary dinner in the heart of New York. All of it, the ambience is pretty unique as well. As you get in, they give you some ""tickets"" so you go to the counter you want and select the food which they will flag in the ticket. We went for the famous pastrami sandwich, which was huge!!!

  If you've been to New York but never been to Katz, you've never been to New York. Serving the meanest, baddest pastrami sandwiches and more, this joint has a rich history and some awesome grub.

Warning: servings are huge for non-locals. I did eventually finish off mine, but not without effort. Make sure you order a side of baked beans and pickles, too.

If meat is not your thing (what!!!), opt for the cheese sandwich which is generous as well.

  A trip to New York isn?t complete without having pastrami in this iconic institution. A relic of a bygone era, they just don?t make sandwich shops like this anymore. I first heard of this shop while watching an episode of Anthony Bourdain?s No Reservations. Watching that segment in front of a HD screen just made me wanted to have some Montreal smoked meat the next day. Of course that wasn?t the same thing, because that was incomparable to what I was about to have. ...

  Katz Delicatessen is one of the foremost staples of all things New York. It's quick, if you're not quick and orderly you will get hammered by a 50 dollar lost ticket fee, and it's simply amazing.
I ordered the Reuben sandwich and was surprised to see how high the cost for a sandwich was ($20 on average). Then I saw the size of the meaty behemoth and quickly changed my tune. Not only do they give you a decent sized plate of pickles and cucumber, but they give you a taste of the meat before you get your sandwich. It was an epiphany in the preparation of pastrami. Those are words I never thought to be written.

  This week?s ?Throwback Thursday? post is about Katz?s Deli in New York City?s Lower East Side, which I visited a year or so ago on a business trip.

  It's a crazily busy place but it is much bigger than expected. I was tied between ordering the pastrami sandwich or the reuben which uses the corn beef. The corn beef was tasty and soft, but the pastrami sample I received was warm and almost melted in my mouth, it was a no brainer. I ordered the pastrimi on rye and the chicken soup.

  We stay near Central Park so in the past we have always gone to Carnegie deli for our fix. This past trip Carnegie's was closed for renovations. so we trekked off to Katz Deli where Harry met Sally.
Were we disappointed. This place gives the customer a piece of paper that you then take to multiple sections at a long counter to receive items wanted. Pop form one person, sandwich from another. They each add to your paper what you owe. You then take the items to a table ( but not the server tables - which we didn't know existed until we sat in the wrong place with our tray) You even have to get your own glass of water.
Both of us had corned beef on rye, and my fiend had a beer, I had pop.  The sandwich was no better than Carnegie Deli and next time I will sit in a nice table and be served in what is not a cafeteria. The prices definitely weren't any less at this place so I know I wont be back.",25-Jun-15,Theresa

   Expensive and mediocre. My former NYer husband and I hit Katz's last night on the city. We were looking forward to the classic deli food. He ordered the corned beef sandwich ($19!) which came cold, sliced thick and fatty. I ordered the tuna ($13), soggy chunk light. I paid $5.50 for slaw, so runny, white goo slopped over the plate. Also a knish, that was frozen and then microwaved into basically a ball of mashed potatoes.

The best part of the meal was the pickles, mustard, and the Dr Brown's ($2.75 a can!), none of which is made at the deli.

   It's where I met hot pastrami. Katz's Deli, ahhh...it's an institution which makes it a tourist attraction in it's own right. The first time I went I encountered a huge line and decided not to wait because it'd be at least 2hrs..bugger that for a sandwich. The next day I was sure to arrive early and grab my ticket thus making sure I'd get to experience this institution.

The process is easy enough..take your ticket and approach the sandwich maker who will give you a sample of the pastrami, give him a tip and then tell him what you'd like. Then move down the line to the drinks and finally the desserts...then go find yourself a seat and gorge yourself silly on the finest sandwich you'll eat.

I look forward to returning this July.",14-Mar-14,Mr MM Smith

   The cost and wait outweigh the experience. I had heard a lot about Katz's from friends and TV so I opted to try it out. At any given time there are about ten guys making sandwiches so you choose one man's line and wait. Although I appreciate the notion of hand-cutting the meat right in front of me, it took forever. Disclaimer: there is also an option to be seated and waited on, but I feel this would probably take even longer.

Katz's hand cuts and brings out a fresh chuck of pastrami for each sandwich. Mouth wateringly decadent with fat oozing out after each bite, these sandwiches are hot (not room temperature and machine cut like other places) and demands devouring. The spicy mustard marries perfectly and you can always order a side of fries (giant order) that's fried in chicken fat. Yep, absolute decadence.

   Nothing to get excited about. Today was the day I got to experience the famous Katz deli. After a convoluted seating and ticket process we sat down and ordered 3x pastrami sandwiches a cheeseburger and fries. The start was fantastic with some wonderful pickles that we the appetite, then after a short wait the sandwiches and burger came out. I'm not sure what i was expecting but the pastrami on rye was underwhelming and didn't pack the punch I was going for. The bread was ok and I think would benefit from some light sauce or even a grilling. The pastrami itself was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth but just didn't have the bags of flavour I was reaching for. The fries on the other hand were really nice and lifted the meal. To summarize I'm a little unsure why Katz is so huge when they only offer good sandwiches not amazing ones. It's a once only trip to put a tick in the box, but $20 inc tax etc for a god damn sanga is just nuts.

This is the benchmark for all New York Deli?s and apart from Russ and Daughters, which we never got to try sadly, this is probably the most popular deli in the world. You can either do table service along the side walls or queue and risk trying to get a seat, which could be difficult as Katz is always full and I mean full. Now you could say that when a joint has so much publicity its either a PR department on overdrive or there is actually some truth in it and every journo, film crew are just jumping on the bandwagon. ...

   Legendary and great food, but pricey. Katz's is a New York City legend and deservedly so. All the food I've ever had there is great. The pastrami and roast beef are excellent. The matzo ball soup is famous. I really like the pickle plate they start you off with. It's usually pretty easy to get seated, and you have the option of serving yourself cafeteria style.

If you go, keep in mind that the prices are relatively high (maybe not by NYC standards). For a party of two, expect to spend $50. (Of course, in most of America, two can have the same menu for $30-35.)",27-Jun-12,Tony

   Don't lose your ticket. but great food. I really loved this place, the food was simple yet tasty, the restaurant had a really great vibe and the service was good (except for the security guy who looked like he was going to hit me when I couldn't find my ticket. I don't know how it got to the bottom of my shopping bag, but it did). Fortunately we escaped sans bruises, so DON'T LOSE YOUR TICKET. The famous pastrami sandwich was a hit at our table, and I loved the traditional pickles and fries. Would definitely go back when next in NY.

You're given a ticket when you walk and then find the proper place to order. Make your way down the counter after getting each part of the meal (sandwich, fries, soda, etc.) and then find an open table.

   PASTRAMI OM NOM NOM. It's worth going to Katz's just for the pastrami sandwich. Fatty, juicy, spicy meat soaks into the rye bread. The richness is cut through perfectly by the mustard. It's a beautiful thing.

Honestly, that's all I would get at Katz's (except maybe a Dr. Brown's). Everything else I've tried there has been unjustifiably expensive and mostly unenjoyable. Knishes were low-quality (didn't seem homeade at all). Matzoh-ball was OK but not a lot of flavor in the soup... very mediocre.

   My favorite deli in NYC. Walk in, take a number, get in line and ask for a taste of the pastrami and corned beef to make up your mind. They are like butter.

   The Original Jewish Happy Meal!!!. For lunch, we head over to the Lower East Side to the legendary Katz's Delicatessen where the food is so good? it makes New Yorkers stop talking/whining (during lunch). It doesn't get any more authentic NYC than Katz's? this is the home to the original ""Jewish Happy Meal""- matzo ball soup, potato knishes, pastrami sandwich and real deli pickles! It's also home to Meg Ryan's famous fake-orgasm scene but for those of us who have ever had their Roast Beef sandwich and Potato Latkes knows? she wasn't faking it.

PRICE: $$ Great price for a killer-kosher sandwich

   Worth the Hype?. We hiked the half mile + from the Broadway subway to check out the famous Katz Deli. Was it worth it? Well, the brisket is very good.

   Lean pastrami Reuben is to die for!. We finally made it to Katz's Deli this year, after previously trying both Stage Deli and Carnegie Deli. After biting into our sandwich, it was Katz's for the win.

We ordered a lean pastrami Reuben, Matzo ball soup and half-sour pickles. The taste of pastrami was fantastic and I couldn't wait for the sandwich to be built. Once we gathered our order we sat at a table several down from the one made famous in When Harry Met Sally and chowed down. The Reuben was a.ma.zing. Truly spectacular...so much better than both Stage and Carnegie that it wasn't even like comparing apples to apples.

Carnegie, however, won on the Matzo ball soup. The soup at Katz's was missing the intense chicken flavor of Carnegie, so Carnegie won the soup round.

To give you a better idea, we were plotting how to get more Reubens delivered from Katz's to Seattle as we're only in NYC about once a year. We already miss that darn sandwich.",8-Feb-11,Thetripchick

   Pastrami can't save it. Pastrami is damn good, but is it worth the hassle and frustration of what is generally a pretty crap dining experience?

The only excuse for anyone to be here this late on a Saturday night is to imbibe stomach-coating peppery, fatty meat ...

   Came at the right time!. My mom and I arrived for lunch right before the line started building. I was intimidated at first, but the guys behind the counter were very friendly. Their pastrami sandwich had just the right seasonings and it's huge! We should have split one. Their cucumbers and green tomatoes weren't for me, but my mom liked them. One thing- they only take cash!! And the sandwich cost $14. But it is New York",31-Dec-10,Lex

   Know before you GO.... When you first walk into Katz the guy at the door hands you a ticket and tells you to keep moving in, not much space to move. I had no clue what I was doing, so what you do is get on line for your food hand over your ticket and they put a price on it. Then if you want a drink get on line for it hand your ticket and get a new price. I think that its worth the hassle yeah its crowded over priced and it was a pain finding a seat.

   Out of towner not disappointed. I grew up a foodie, and watching Katz's Deli on the the TV (Food Network, Travel Channel) I was super excited to finally try it. In fact, I went twice in one trip, making two meals out each sandwich! A little bit of Americana in my opinion.

The tongue sandwich was great, with a little pastrami. Feeling adventurous, you should try it. It's not as crazy as it sounds. The guys behind the counter were cool too. Had a little chat with them while I watched him cut it to order.

Piece of advice--that tip cup is not there for nothing. Use it. And I suggest you tip before they make your sandwich. Just do it.",5-Nov-10,ONI

   Don't fall for it. We came here on a mission to try a real NY deli. If this is it - I am disappointed. It wasn't easy to get to so we opted for the waiter service over the counter. We sat at a recently vacated table and awaited a busser or waiter. Neither came and after a move to another table we finally got acknowledged. We ordered a pitcher of beer, a Reuben with extra Russian dressing and a frankfurter with everything. The beer came first, then the pickles, the Reuben -minus the extra dressing and then several minutes later the frankfurter. Overall - we've had much better food and I guess we should have ordered at the counter. We felt the server was just annoyed by us. The check for this feast was $50 - really?",8-Sep-10,Kellyhende

   All killer, no filler.. Katz's is an institution. For my first trip there, was there really anything I could get but the pastrami? The answer of course is a resounding ""no,"" and for good reason.

Katz's pastrami sandwiches bring the heat. They take this stuff as seriously as us southerners take our bbq pork. The pastrami itself is so tender that it literally melts in your mouth. On rye and slathered with a copious amount of mustard and a mountain of meat, this sandwich is one for the ages, and a perfect hangover cure after a night on the town. Steak fries on the side might have been a bit much but they were right on point. My buddy's knish was solid as well. I also really liked the lightly pickled cucumbers on the side.

The service is great here, too. The guys making your sandwiches do it with a smile, and the owner still makes his rounds to check on the patrons. A lot of hospitality and a mound of comfort food make Katz's a sure thing.",20-Aug-10,Charlie

   Good Turkey Sandwiches. We usually go to Katz's at least once a year. It is not somewhere we go often, but a treat when we do. When you go inside they will give you a ticket. DO NOT LOSE this ticket or it will cost you. This ticket is where the carver will write your order. I usually get the Turkey on a roll with swiss cheese and tomato. You get to watch the carver make your sandwich right in front of your eyes. Then you get to choose which kind of pickles you want. My turkey has always been warm, moist and delicious. I have never gotten a bad sandwich here. Plus, they are HUGE. There is at least enough for 2 servings here. Overall, we have had great experiences with Katz's and I would visit again.

   You Let me down. Last week while visiting NYC some relatives and I decided to visit our old haunt Katz's Deli for a nosh. Although the ambiance has been maintained over generations, the food seems to have changed and not for the better. I ordered my Fave?Matzo ball soup and a half Coned Beef Sandwich. Much to my disappointment the Matzo Ball was all busted up. It did not live up to its colorful description in the menu. Although the sandwich was piled customarily high with meat?.it was so dry I could have used it to absorb my entire cup of soup. Possibly this was an off day last Monday 10/24 about 7pm.

   As real as it gets...as if they care.... The quintessential Jewish Deli. My Grandmother Marilyn took me for my first time, and chuckled when the waiter refused to bring me what I ordered. He forced me to eat my first pastrami sandwich - not only brought it instead of the hamburger I ordered, but sat at our table and waited for me to take a bite of the enormous hot thick cut pastrami sandwich on rye.

   Epic pastrami. A mountainous heaping of juicy brined briskets of black pepper coated pastrami, hand sliced, gently smoked with a smear of mustard and placed between two slices of rye bread . The sandwich was luscious and generous: I understand why it is ranked among the best in the world. Stick with this and that's all that you'll need at Katz.

Waited quite some time to be noticed by waiting staff and place our order from drinks. We discovered that all the food we selected from the buffet was cold before we'd even sat down at the table. They did apologise when we complained and suggested that we return to the buffet once it had been reheated.No regular coffee refills from waitress until we asked for this.

  One of the best rooftop bars in the city. Splendid view and nice ambience. This is a pretty spacious place and it's heated, so that's a bonus! They don't have a ton of options in food but well, we already knew that before heading over. We were mainly there to have a couple of drinks and then head over to another place to have dinner. If you get a little chilly, they even have these soft, fluffy red blankets for you so you can get cozy. Only thing is the server kept coming over to ask us whether we needed refills when we hadn't even finished our first drink. Other than that, I really enjoyed this place and had a lovely time with friends!

   AMAZING ROOFTOP LOUNGE. I LOVE this place! As you exit the elevator on the 20th floor you walk into a beautiful lounge with floor to ceiling windows and comfortable modern furniture. Walk up the stairs and you are in paradise on a roof top lounge! The views are amazing, especially at night. You can see the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. The brunch buffet is only $29 and the staff is extremely friendly. The lounge looks like what you've seen on TV for a big city: young, trendy people hanging out, sipping cocktails at low tables that encourage the flow of conversation. One thing I didn't like instead of having a glass wall around the roof, they had a wall of foliage obstructing some of the view.

The cocktails are delicious and strong. This is great anytime of the day...brunch, lunch, afternoon pick me up drink, happy hour, dinner, late night you name it. Its such a comfortable place to hang out with friends and sip some drinks.",23-Aug-12,Model MB

   Do yourself a favour and give this place a miss. If you're after sleaze then go to hooters. If you're after a classy new York style bar then try somewhere the locals frequent not the uninformed tourists. The service is shite, the decor dated and dirty, the view uninspiring and music too loud. The kingdom of sleaze.

   Impressive. I love to take out-of-towners here. It's a nice place to have a celebration too. Its a very large space. And very good for larger groups. 230 fifth is a New York experience without the touristy feeling even though it does attract many visitors.

I have never been here on a weekend night I can only imagine how busy it would be. If I was younger I would def come on a busy night.

The food really depends on the dish, I love the Short Rib Beef Rendang. and the Calamari It is absolutely delicious. You can even have an enjoyable brunch here. And their menu is huge and simple. The view is incredible. and could really make a good night/weekend.

This place is what Manhattan does best - wowing to no end. It is worth a visit, undoubtedly, even if the drinks are a little pricier than your average dive bar.

In short, if your looking for something different and want to wow your friends bring them here.",5-Jan-12,Ronnie

   Up and up. The 230 Fifth Garden is probably one of the best outdoor bars in the city. It is one the largest outdoor bars you can actually walk around, watch people and pick who you want to mingle with. During the warm climate months is always filled with professional and college types.

Selection of beers is pretty small 3 to be exact.But full bar selection. Atmosphere is comfortable and casual and being on 5th and 27th your close to more bars to wander around to.

   No dinner without attitude. We chanced a visit to this establishment at 4:45pm on a Sunday evening. It turned into a major drama to get a dinner menu to order from as they apparently serve ""brunch"" until 5pm, despite the fact that their evening menu stated that it was served from 4pm on.
I abhor having to struggle with waitstaff over a 10 minute issue when all it would have taken was some level of courtesy to take our order and have it cooked first up when the kitchen changed.

   Horrible door staff. With rooftop bars popping up all over NYC, 230 Fifth is no longer worth it (maybe when it first opened 4 years ago). The door staff is rude, bad music, nothing special about the crowed. It really shocked me how well dressed people are pulled out of the line because of the color of their skin. Takes a while for drinks, which are nothing special. Do yourself a favor and check out the Sky Room, HiBar, or any of the other new rooftop bars. The decor is outdated and stale.

The pizzas are crisp, thin crust and their sauce is a secret that produces a magical flavor with the first bite.

  Just Loved It. While cracker-like bar pies have never been on my list of favorites, Rubirosa has shown me something new. This isn't bar pie, but the crust is similar, it is what I understand as a ""Staten Island"" style pie. The tomato and cheese work perfectly to provide flavor I didn't think was possible.

We have three varieties: vodka pizza with vodka sauce and fresh mozzarella, caprese with pesto, tomato, and homemade stracciatella cheese, and pizza with sausage and broccoli rabe. ...

   Wonderful Food and Service. My wife and I had a wonderful lunch at Rubirosa. We ordered the fried calamari and split a small fresca pizza. The calamari (tender, sweet, and crisp)came with a side of marinara dipping sauce. The pizza was amazing: Crisp thin flavorful crust, excellent sauce, creamy mozzarella, and fresh basil. It was simply a taste explosion that got better with each bite. Small bowls of condiments were provided to sprinkle on the pizza. We made a mistake by ordering the small pizza instead of the large---light, flavorful and simple eating pleasure!

   The service is great, as advertised. But they try a little too hard and can make you feel a little claustrophobic. The tables are also very close together. The food is good and there are celebrities to see.

It was more difficult for me to say ""like it"" to this restaurant than it should have been. Mainly because of how seriously the restaurant takes itself.

  Came here for lunch on Wednesday with a friend on her lunch break! I chose Miss Korea because of the yuk gae jang (spicy beef soup) which is my go to Korean dish back in Auckland.

We were seated quickly and service was friendly and efficient! As soon as we made our orders they brought out eight side dishes! Yuuuuum it was nice to see some of my favourites! The seaweed is still my fave side dish and tastes just as good here as it does in New Zealand! My soup came out shortly after! My rice was nice and fluffy and the soup was delicious! It was flavorful and the perfect amount of spicy. My friend got the cod soup and she liked that as well.

I wish we had a little bit more time than an hour to eat though because we were slightly rushed and I couldn't finish my soup! I would definitely come back here!
