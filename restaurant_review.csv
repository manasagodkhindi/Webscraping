  Really like this place. Great atmosphere, friendly service (mostly) and tasty food. Nice wine list but with an expensive lean. Had some great dishes, however both fish dishes were quite overcooked. An amateur move for a veteran and at these prices. Understand they're moving soon which is a bit of a shame, but also a good opportunity to do something about the crappy washroom situation (sorry, not sorry for pun)",Union Square Cafe,20-Oct-15,Hung Dong Long

  Another place downtown that has seen better days. We went a year or so back, so this review is a tad bit tardy, but the steak was a tad bit overcooked for rare, and the second one was too undercooked for medium.

This one is on par with the first one, complete with roasted honey-crisp apples on top.

The burger was tuna meat that was chopped up, put back together, and grilled. The fish didn’t taste fresh at all and the side of coleslaw was absolutely…THE WORST. We also weren’t really impressed with their service (so slow it was like pulling teeth to get service). Not expected at all for a Danny Meyer restaurant and a very disappointing experience overall.

  Had an amazing experience here, just wanted to talk about the people who attended to our table which enhanced our time here. Enjoyed the cocktail cart in which the bartender whipped us up 5 different versions of the Manhattan cocktail while conversing with us about our time in New York. The sommelier assisted us in picking out a couple of wines to go with our food as well as keeping the balance reasonable. One of the waitresses was equally as charismatic while preparing our one of our dishes, malt - egg cream with vanilla and seltzer.

Hubs is a fussy eater, however his affliction actually turned out to be highly advantageous for our EMP experience. 
Caviar, fish and foie gras courses were replaced with alternative dishes, which meant I got to sample several additional plates, which [of course] were all amazing. In fact, hubs’ off piste eggs benedict with truffles trumped my standard eggs benedict with caviar!

"Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook By: Laurie Wallin Capital Cooking Contributor There’s one surefire thing about NYC – no matter where you turn, there’s amazing food and wine waiting for you around every corner. My husband and I spent some time in the Big Apple over the weekend celebrating our anniversary and were lucky to dine enough at some of the city’s biggest gems – Per Se, Le Bernadin, and Eleven Madison Park. The iconic blue doors of the French Laundry welcomed us to Per Se. We were whisked away to a romantic table for two overlooking the dining room and upon noticing that I’d placed my clutch on the floor, a server came over right away with a stool for my bag. The dining room is the epitome of romantic – quiet, cozy, and a giant stone fireplace anchors the room. The view is absolutely outstanding, overlooking Central Park and the NYC skyline. ...

Some meals had a bit of theatre and drama and while the food was prepared to a high standard and quality, in some dishes I didn’t think the ingredients always paired well in terms of flavour. There were some really clever techniques employed such as the numerous ways they utilised tomato, but in the end, it’s all about the taste and it didn’t reach the high levels I was expecting. ...

"There is a certain level of theatre when coming to a three michelin starred restaurant and the next dish certainly provided a level of theatre with the clam bake. A tradition on Long Island, the next dish was a series of clam inspired dishes all centred around a pot of clam chowder. The 'Littleneck Clam' consisted of clambake with whelk, a parker house roll and the chowder. The clam chowder came out in a pot and the waitress added some water to the vessel and a wonderful steam enveloped the table. I particularly loved the clambake with the whelk, which had a lovely flavour and texture.

   Food was good, experience was amazing.. Remember when your parents told you not to play with your food. EMP definitely didn't listen and it was one of the best dining experience I had. If you have 3 hours to spare in NYC, definitely get a table, if you can at EMP. The staff prepares for you about 18-22 dishes and the presentation is immaculate. Food was spectacular, but did meet my standard for a fine dining. EMP is more about the entire experience as the presentation was visually stunning and definitely worth the wait.

We'd barely settled into our first evening, getting through the amuse bouches when the final one - a signature beet and goats cheese lollipop - had us in raptures.

More courses, albeit many of them being the same as our first foray, demonstrated an extraordinary level of skill and an amazing palate from Humm and his team. While the team serving us was different, we once again connected with sommelier Robert who recommended more wine choices, including a delightful bottle of red from, of all places, Walla Walla. ...

"Final Verdict: If you’re talking about the overall dining experience and ignoring cost, I give Per Se the slight edge for telepathic service and cozier space. However, it also feels like more of an extravagance, and charges you accordingly. EMP serves a more reasonable amount of food in their “four” course menu which makes it a place I feel you can return to more frequently. And if you’re a foodie basing your decision primarily on the food aspect, I think you’ll find spending the same amount for two meals at EMP as one at Per Se is the way to go. Of course, I highly recommend you try both of them at least once. ...

Loved the menu concept but don't want to tell you ahead of time to spoil the surprise. Definintely in the top 2 best dinners we had in New York.

It was supposed to be a fun experience for my daughter so the grouchy service was really disappointing. The lemon ice box pie was not worth $8.50 for a slice, it was ok at best.",Serendipity 3,2 months ago,Jennab

  I have always loved serendipity 3. I just love coming here whenever I visit New York. My favourite is Frozen hot chocolate. Just delicious , mouth watering and with the big portion , its hard to share.

  I thoroughly enjoyed Serendipity 3, however that being said, I did not find them as profound as I'd heard they were. They had tasty milkshakes, not the best I've had. And the food was normal considering the price you pay. They get a lot of buzz but as much as I liked it I don't think it's worth the price. The most I'd insist on going there for is the ground floor seating decoration. Which we didn't really get to see because we were seated upstairs.",Serendipity 3,7 months ago,Nadia T

  This place has the best desserts in my opinion, they never disappoint. Their food, or should I say ""serious food"" is really good. I always go for the burgers. The place is always full, at least the times that I have visited, I've had to wait anywhere from 30- 1hr and a half. This just goes to show how popular this place is NYC and with good reason. The place is also not huge, so I guess that makes a difference. I also love the decor; they did a great job with it. I feel like that attracts a lot of people as well.",Serendipity 3,8 months ago,Jesse Ham

  Love love love this place. Every time I go to New York, this is on my must do list. We've only had dessert here and the frozen hot chocolate is a brilliant creation. It is so big that even between the two of us, we can't finish half of it.
Confession, I was first drawn to this place because of the movie, Serendipity, staring Kate Beckinsale. It still remains as one of my favourite movies - you must watch it if you haven't! It's a rom com that will make you laugh and cry, and help you believe in fate.",Serendipity 3,9 months ago,Jadie

  After watching Serendipity and Gossip Girls, when you go to NYC, the first thing you do is that you go to Serendipity and live the dream.

Yes stepping inside this place and just like a dream come true.

You feel as if you are walking into a dreamland. Everything from lamps to walls looks just out of fairy tale.

I have been just lucky that I went to this on its 60th Anniversary.

Serendipity is a small dessert place on the UPPER EAST SIDE and a small black door.

This is famous for its Frozen Hot Chocolate and without any delay I ordered the same.

It is served in a big bowl, which you would first feel is too small for you but once you start sipping it, the bowl never ends.

Must try once in lifetime and do go with your partner or best buddy.

Loved it!",Serendipity 3,29-Jan-16,Bhupesh Jatiani

Frozen hot chocolate The verdict: not really what I was expecting. It was just chocolate blended with crushed ice until it becomes granita-like with a huge dollop of cream on top. In that respect, it was quite light because of the watery base. I was expecting something thicker with a milk base – I guess like a normal hot chocolate.

Sandwich I got (that I was required to by in orde to try the frozen hot chocolate...ANNOYING!) was terrible and dry. My five year old makes better sandwiches. The frozen hot chocolate had to have been a bad batch. I have head so many rave reveiws about this and it was AWFUL! All four people at my table got one and didnt finish it.

   Yum yum yum.... Frozen hot chocolate is the favourite but Cheescake Vesuvius is a close second. Three Aussie sisters and a family friend having a reunion, regressing back to childhood and acting like 7 year olds devouring Frozen hot chocolates and the Cheesecake Vesuvius. Our Serendipity 3 experience lived up to its name - not just the food but the venue and staff (I can't remember the waiters name but he was an absolute riot - incredibly funny and entertaining).

We went in the afternoon on a weekday in Sept 2010 - so no 3 hour wait, we were seated straight away. Also lucky enough to meet and have a quick chat to Stephen Bruce, who was so sweet and lovely to us!",Serendipity 3,9-Jul-11,Moops

   Seredip-Horrible Service.. A huge secret from most tourists, and incredibly difficult to find. The wait was horrible, but expected. The food was good. Everyone around us had ordered a Frozen Hot Chocolate, appearantly they are amazing. I would recommend sharing one, as they seemed huge and most people did share. I wouldn't expect anything more than a unique atmosphere and horrible service. Worth it? Your call.",Serendipity 3,24-May-11,FoodBasics
"Worth the wait. Reservations are in your best interest but, the area is nice so the wait isn't to terribly bad. The FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE was the only reason we visited this cozy restaurant.

The Frozen Hot Chocolate was WELL worth the wait!!",Serendipity 3,9-Mar-11,MWilliams

   Exactly what you want it to be.. If you need a gorgeous sundae with strawberry ice cream topped with marshmallow and caramel (my favorite), it doesn't get better than Serendipity.

"A sweet whimsical ride. Okay. So I was seriously arm twisted into visiting Serendipity. But it was literally a few short blocks from my apartment and my out-of-town friends took care of dinner reservations - ie, minimum effort in getting to my dining experience.

The restaurant is kitsch, loud and not to mention, a real light and color explosion! But hey, lots of fun!

The famed frozen hot chocolate was a diabetic and weight watcher's nightmare, but was sweet and delicious. The food was somewhat average, but I had zero expectations of the quality of my dinner, so I was not disappointed. In fact, I came away feeling like I've had a rather unexpectedly nice experience!

I wouldn't travel across town to eat here, but Serendipity is somewhat iconic here in NYC - sometimes one just has to jump in. (Alright, I was pushed….but I very happily survived.)",Serendipity 3,12-Dec-10,Otani

   Personally, I like the Serendipity in Vegas better, but you can't visit NYC without at least trying to get a table here. We were lucky and only waited about 15 minutes for a table. Ordered the BLT and Cheddar burger. The food was alright, but nothing spectacular. The BLT was huge though, so it could be shared. The real reason we went though was because I wanted a frozen hot chocolate. I remember the one I had in Vegas being better, but it was still delicious. I would recommend people to visit here, at least for the desserts, but if your wait is more than a half hour I don't know if I'd bother. It's good, but not epic.",Serendipity 3,30-Oct-10,Kate C

   Poor Service. Wish I could recommend this place based on it's media hype. Frrrozen Hot Chocolate was good and my wife would return for it. I did not care for the over worked decor and furnishings. The service was horribly slow ( too many scattered tables for number of staff) and they could not get my order out. Waited 30 minutes for a table. Had Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, ordered Root beer and ended up with 1 Pepsi after they could not change the syrup during the 45 minutes we spent waiting for our whole order to be ready. Kitchen failed to produce burger during this time period. Staff made a feeble apology and didn't care. Paid bill and got the hell out.",Serendipity 3,26-Jul-10,MadisonKobalt

   This place sucked. I waited for over an hour for a ten dollar Sunday I could have gotten at basken Robbins and a frozen hot chocolate that tasted like an old hot chocolate blended with chunky bits of ice.

   Expensive dessert. My wife and I went here after dinner for some dessert. We ate a pretty good size brownie, vanilla ice cream, and hot fudge sundae that we split. It was pretty good but I didn't think it was anything to write home about. We didn't eat dinner there so can't comment but from what we saw, it looked really good. The atmosphere was very interesting with the decor and chandeliers. Good experience but probably won't eat another $15.00 +tax+tip=$20.00 sundae.

   A Fun Experience. I had heard a lot about this place and decided to check it out to see if it lived up to the hype. Glad to say that it did.

It was late night and the place was crowded, but I didn't have to wait to get a table. Service was brisk, but friendly enough. The decor was fun and the ice cream treats were amazing. Add in the illustrious history of this place and you have a winner.

The ice cream itself is very good. I believe they use Haagen Daaz ice cream. They became too busy to use their own production some time ago. At least, this is what my waiter told me.

In addition to the delicious nature of their creations, they put a lot of effort into presentation as well. I saw a lot of people taking pictures of their orders with cell phone cameras, before digging in with their spoons.

The prices are a bit high, but I would definitely go back again.",Serendipity 3,15-Jun-10,Intrepid Diner
"Worth the wait once for the experience. My daughter finally talked me into taking her to Serendipity and although it was a nice ice cream experience (that we were forced to combine with dinner) I do not think I will be doing it again anytime soon.

We went for afternoon tea and there was a 1 1/2 hour wait. Fortunately, you can leave your name and then wonder off to Bloomies (which we did). When we returned almost 1 1/2 hours later, we still had to wait another 30 minutes. I felt as if I were in a line at an amusement park and that is something I do not cherish.

So, my advice is that if you have to have this fix, make a reservation (preferably months in advance) and you will be able to walk straight in. Otherwise, do not wait in line.

The ice cream is good and the food is not bad, but there are more relaxing dining experiences.",Serendipity 3,14-Jun-10,Portsmouth Foodie

   It is not that serious..... Ok, so we had reservations but for those who didnt..the wait time was over 2HOURS!!! once we were in, i saw that the decor was absolutely atrocious! it seemed like every grandmother was called upon to find their oldest dustiest flower curtains and whatever else they had and threw it around the restaurant. the food was flavorless but if i could order something different i would have what my sister ordered which was the ""Chicken Diva"" meal. we also ordered the frozen hot chocolate and it was pretty tasty.

now to the Dessert! They had the most delicious biggest portions i have ever seen or had! my table of four shared the strawberry cheescake sundae and also the black chocolate sundae. absolutely amazing! it was a bit pricey for a sundae but if i ever go back i would skip the meal and just order the sundaes.

Outside of the burgers, the selection of beers can’t be beat.  In addition, the gastro pub menu features a medley of interesting takes on traditional pub fare.  I first came here for a work meeting years ago and have returned countless times over the years.  For my money, they have the best burgers in NYC.

  Welcome to the Spotted Pig, April Bloomfield’s cosy gastropub in Chelsea. You’ll find it by the cute spotted pig hanging above the entrance out in the lush front garden. April Bloomfield is an English chef with great credentials, she was originally scouted by Mario Batali before moving to New York to open the Spotted Pig. We visited just after the venue lost the Michelin star it had held since 2005, being downgraded to the Bib Gourmand guide. Nevertheless the achievement of this venue cannot be understated, to hold a star as a gastropub is to say the venue could compete with the finest of restaurants around the world while still being accessible and affordable to many.The space is small but it adds to the atmosphere. The decor is eclectic, warm and cheerful with a friendly and welcoming buzz as you enter. We visited on a weekend and gained the brunch options as well as the usual lunch choices. ...

  The Spotted Pig is a Michelin starred pub
Deviled Eggs: a reference in the house. A tart, almost pickled flavor to the filling with a definite hit of mustard heat, light and fresh. Hidden crystals of salt crackle between the teeth.
Devils on Horseback: bacon wrapped dates that were the perfect blend of sweet and savory. The bacon was melt in the mouth and was complemented by the sweetness of the dates. The sauce tied it all together very nicely and interestingly. Definitely a dish worth trying.
Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestring Fries: This is a must try. The burger is simple, just with blue cheese and soft grilled bun the meat, it melted in the mouth, bursting with flavor. The shoestring fries with garlic and rosemary that came with it were a triumph all on their own. The burger is, even so, over hyped and priced.

So, you can imagine my excitement when I was entering The Spotted Pig in New York for the first time. For the uninitiated, The Spotted Pig is a Michelin starred gastro pub run by British celebrity chef, April Bloomfield. ...

  The Spotted Pig is a Michelin-starred ‘gastro pub’, reputedly British in style, and apparently – if top search engine results are to be believed – where certain celebrities hang out (and where numpty celebrity-stalkers go to try and see numpty celebrities. All this numpty celebrity stuff put me off. Who cares? really?).

We happened to be passing The Spotted Pig anyway, and it looks so appealing and small and befitting its local community with all the pussy-willows and plants and pig decorations outside (a bit like your local flower shop) that we just had to step inside to check it out. Enjoying the friendly bar service as well as the appealing pig-themed interior with funky food fabric stools (bacon patterns, pepper prints, etc) we decided to have a late lunch at the bar after all… ...

  I didn’t think that British food and yummy could be used in a sentence together until I went to the Spotted Pig.

April Bloomfield is the super talented chef behind the deliciousness of this gastro pub. The popularity of the Spotted Pig has started a whole trend of people milling towards gastro pubs in the city.

This little bohemian spot in the West Village offers seasonal British and Italian dishes on its menu, which are adapted from popular pub food. Just try their killer Gnudi, which are these “to die for” dumplings made with sheep’s milk ricotta. Their deviled eggs are divine as is their outstanding Banoffee pie for dessert.

 

The Spotted Pig is just one of those places that you cannot get enough off. I think I can safely say…that I’m hooked!!

  Can't go past a blue cheese burger and shoestring fries!

Not the easiest place to get to, but had to go try it out. The burger can get a bit try due to the large bun. Shoestring is probably the wrong description, it's more like spaghetti fries and you'll be amazed at how much of it you can eat.

  Heard great reviews about the burger so we went there to try. Liked the first impression when I stepped into the restaurant. It is a cosy English pub with small and big piggy decor.

"The Spotted Pig  in New York is so hot right now – it was recommended by chef Gary Mehigan, from Australia’s MasterChef, and by another esteemed food, wine, and beer writer in Australia. A Michelin-starred gastro pub, the couple sitting next to us at Malaparte also said it was on their list of places to go. Reading reviews, many recommended avoiding the long queues by going for lunch instead of dinner, which is what we did. The eclectic interior of The Spotted Pig, New York Walking in, it felt like I’d entered a little pub in the English countryside. It was small, walls adorned with eclectic artwork, mainy depicting pigs. I felt a little sorry our friendly host who seated us straight away because we weren’t overly warm and friendly ourselves.

Rather than do loads of blog posts (I really can't be arsed nowadays) here's a round-up of some of my favourite eats in the Big Apple. The dimly-lit dining room at Minetta Tavern , while terrible for food photography, is one of the most buzzy, atmospheric ones I've eaten in. And I've eaten in a lot. I kicked off with a generous portion of roasted bone marrow served with shallot confit and baguette soldiers while my friend went with roast baby beets . Both got the thumbs up. For mains, we both ordered the legendary Black Label burger . Made with prime cuts of dry-aged beef, topped with caramelized onions and served in a sesame-topped brioche bun, this was without doubt the best burger I've ever eaten. Oh, and the big mountain of fries were bloody amazing, too. Overall, Minetta Tavern was probably my favourite out of all the restaurants I visited in New York. This begs the questi ...

I had the deviled eggs appetizer and they were overpriced, $4.00 for 2 halves (1whole egg) and did not taste good to me. I waited 45 minutes for a table and the burger was simply OK. The fries were very salty and I like salty food but that was ridiculous. I probably wont go back. If the line was shorter I might but I dont need to wait 45 min for what I thought was an average burger. The service was good. Nothing to write home about but nothing to complain about either.",The Spotted Pig,14-Jul-11,ODawg

   Never again. I have eaten in really great restaurants and tasted beautiful food and trust me this place will not fall into either category. When we arrived the place was packed and to say it was loud is an understatement. The wait was an hour. We pushed an shoved our way to the bar and after 15 minutes the bartender finally took our order. The wine selection was terrible and expensive. We couldn't hear each other talk our hear ourselves think for that matter. After we finally got a table which was crammed next to two other tables we saw the menu that lacked choice and explanation. I ordered the $17 burger medium and it came rare. I mean really really rare. I asked our server and he just blew it off saying that their medium is a proper rare.The appetizer sucked it was a bowl of olives in oil and the water was hot. I couldn't wait to leave. The place is a disaster and I left beyond disappointed.",The Spotted Pig,15-May-11,Sssumner

   I have to say i have an unfair amount of expectation built up before i visited the pig... so when i finally went last week i was ready to be wow'ed...

the food is good and definitely met the expectation... but i wasn't ""wow'ed""... to their credit, not many places, including NYC, would be so bold to serve ox tongues, calf livers, burgers with blue cheese, and gnudis on their menu... all of which are very well executed... a bit disappointed at the flourless chocolate cake but the house beer definitely made up for it.

   Amazing!!! The hype is deserved. I went 2 nights ago with a co-worker. I wasn't sure if the place was worth a 30-40 minute wait, but once my food arrived, I realized I might have waited for up to an hour for my dinner. We had the :
Chicken Liver Toast--Outstanding! The onions melted away to nothing, the flavors were just right, and the bread was soft yet crusty.
Devils on Horseback--Poached pears wrapped in prunes wrapped in bacon...sweet, spicy, and savory all at once.
Stuffed Pig's Eat--My dinner. I'm from the south; nothing pork scares me and I'm so glad I ordered this. Stuffed with sweetbreads, it was a fantastic dish. Don't be scared!
The Spotted Pig Burger--My coworkers dinner. The burger was outstanding but the FRIES. . .OMG the Fries!!! Shoestring fries fried with garlic and tossed with Thyme?!?!?

   'Gastropub' Gone WILD!. Yep. Spotted Pig is a GGW. Mind you, in a good way.

I first ate at SP when they opened to massive acclaim, causing seismic shifting in ocean currents and me to wait at their tiny bar, getting hammered, while waiting for an even smaller table.

Ask to be sat upstairs, in one of the corner booths. It's romantic, private and sorta sexy in that 'I Haven't Bathed For Weeks' sorta Village way.

Service is always stellar at The Pig. Great bartenders too. They work in utter chaos, so how they can remember you and pour drinks so darned fast is beyond my comprehension. Kudos.

Yes, their burger is a revelation, but try something else. Scour the menu for interest and detail. Don't just plop down and go with the crowds of Zagat-laden tourists who line up for red meat nirvana...

Even if you don't use catchup, try the house catchup -- it's got some heat and lots of flavor. Very, very noisy.",Old Homestead Steakhouse,30-Jan-11,Kd

   Untrustworthy. Been several times and the steak is amazing. BUT, on our last visit on New Years Eve, the restaurant seemed to be running a scam with regards to its wine list. We ordered a $44 bottle from the menu with the sommelier. When we received the bill, the same wine came out to $62. When I asked our waiter about it, he said it was a computer issue and corrected the mistake. But it was New Years and I doubt most people would pay close enough attention to the bill to catch it. The service was also exceptionally bad (although most of the staff was simply standing around, we had to ask repeatedly for bread and drink refills). I love the steak here, but I'm not sure I would go back after this very bad experience.",Old Homestead Steakhouse,4-Jan-11,Davepl99

   Overpriced / Tenderized. Overpriced for what they serve. Who needs to tenderize a rib eye? The service was good considering the volume of customers our server had to handle. The appetizer of east/west coast oysters and king crab was so-so, the west coast oysters were miniscule. If the meat inside the oyster does not fill up a small oyster fork the kitchen should replace it with a more sizeable oyster, especially if one is paying $4 per piece. The king crab was served cold and didn't have much flavor. The entree arrived and I had to send it back once because the rib-eye was overdone.

Having never visited NYC before we didn't know what to expect and initially were disappointed as it's a fast food outlet in the busy station terminal. However the freshly prepared burgers and fries along with amazing shakes completely made up for it. They were incredibly tasty and not dripping in fat. We had to wait with a buzzer so we knew they had prepared for us and they weren't just sat waiting.

True story: I stood in the rain at almost 11 PM (closing time) on a saturday night in August 2014, just to get a burger. There were rats and roaches running around me.

The burger was delicious, I can’t say anything individually was outstanding but a combination of good ingredients and proper preparation made for one of my favorite meals of the trip. This isn’t a burger that costs $30 or is beef that is made up of expensive cuts of meat. But the simplicity of the burger is what makes it so great. Their ShakeMeister ale (brewed by Brooklyn Brewery) is truly underrated and was a very solid American Pale Ale that pairs nicely with a burger and french fries.

The first experience I had was not very good: it was on a hot Summer day, two years ago. We were walking close to Madison Square Park and decided to try what was supposed to be a mouth watering burger. There was a very long line and considering how hot it was outside, my expectations were high; I manned up. I ordered a cheeseburger and fries. I remember the service was very slow and the kitchen seemed overwhelmed. Then came our order: what a disappointment! The burger was not good at all! The bread was soggy and the meat tasteless. The fries were not crispy at all and had a weird taste. There was clearly something wrong! Then, end of 2011, Shake Shack opened near Time Square. Each time I was passing by, I saw the long line of people waiting for their burgers. I still heard people claiming that this place was the best burger in New York.

"Nelson @ Madison Square Park: We couldn't find this place at first, but as it turns out, it's in the middle of the park in a shack. People have recommended this to me before and considering how long the line was, it seemed like a popular burger place. After tasting it, I know why. The beef itself was so tasty (salty in a good way) and so juicy that it melts in your mouth. Almost the same texture as the melted cheese on top of the patty. The burger is notably done only to medium to be able to get such a great texture/moisture so it is not for the faint of heart. The taste is well worth the risk. One of the best burgers I have ever had. Fries were salty too, but also good and we had to order a shake since it was called Shake Shack.

"Dissapointed. I'm sure many foodies on this site can relate when I say that I did A LOT of research to plan out where to eat during my recent trip to NYC. Shake Shack went on my list as a definite place to check out. as I read they had good burgers that could be compared to In-N-Out (boy, do I miss those burgers).

So there I was, waiting patiently for 20 minutes at 9:30pm. Between my friend and I, we ordered 3 Shackburgers, a peanut butter shake and cheese fries.


BURGERS: I found them lacking in flavour and had to slab on more ketchup to compensate for the missing taste.

SHAKE: Nothing to phone home about. It was damn thick though and hard to drink.

CHEESE FRIES: Best part of the meal. The cheese lays on the fries more dry than wet and saucy which I liked.

Undeterred by the line, we made our way to the express window, where you can bypass the crowds but only if you are ordering concretely. The Concrete starts with a base of a vanilla, chocolate, or the daily featured custard flavor and is mixed with your choice of rich, luscious toppings. As I ordered, I ...

   Lost my gallbladder?. I waited on a very long line (almost 2 hrs) in July 2009 and ordered the 'shroom burger and some kind of ice cream delight with dark chocolate. I am not going to lie: dessert was decadent, the bun was soft and fresh, the mushroom was thick and filled with a tasty combo of cheese.
I dislike on 2 counts: the wait on line in NYC summer heat, and loss of my gallbladder 2 days after eating here. I am a petite girl. I usually do not eat foods this rich. Not to say I was not sick prior, but no doubt the fat and cholesterol
content played a factor in my gallbladder's demise. True story.",Shake Shack,23-Apr-11,Kyrie Mantell
"On our first ever visit to Manhattan, the top of our itinerary list was Shake Shack at Madison Square Park. This is the original location and still the best. Unless you happen to live near another location, don't waste your time anywhere else. When we arrived, the line looked a mile long. We had already walked a long stretch of Madison Avenue to get there. It was hot and we wanted food fast but we decided we would wait. This might be our only chance to experience the legend of Shake Shack. About an hour later, we finally reached the window and placed our order. About 10 or 15 minutes later, the buzzer went off and our dreams came true! This meal was extremely satisfying and well worth the wait. Be warned, weekends and nice weather days can be very busy. If you want to avoid the longest lines, check the Shack Cam first and allow yourself plenty of waiting time just in case. But like I said, totally worth the wait. I'm drooling just looking at this photo. The Shack Burgers are as close a ...

   Just wait in line!. It won't take as long as you think. And it's worth it! The cheese fries! The mushroom burger! Some of the best food in Manhattan, at the best price.

The cheese fries are made with a mornay sauce, not simple melted cheddar or anything easy and obnoxious. These are serious cheese fries, and worth waiting in line (even at its longest, all the way out of the park and onto Madison, it's never taken me longer than 45 minutes).",Shake Shack,10-Feb-11,Inga

  Not up to the the 5 star standard of the Montreal and Las Vegas branches. The food is still mostly excellent with a few notable exceptions: The kefalotiri cheese in the Milos Special (fried zucchini appetizer) was cold and hard (ok it's not a soft cheese but cold it had as much attitude as the very sullen maitre'd ) The spaghetti was so overcooked with the accompanying (perfectly prepared ) lobster it reminded me of canned pasta from my abusive childhood although admittedly with a far superior sauce. All of this could have been forgiven were it not for the abysmal service provided by our very friendly and very inattentive waiter. We also didn't appreciate the nearly 3lb lobster he chose for us without any discussion . A lobster half the size (and price) would have suited us fine.

   Worth the money!. Be prepared to spend considerable amounts of money at this place, but it is WELL worth it! The service was great & the set-up is extremely unique. We loved getting to pick out our fish from the ice. My only regret is that we didn't go with more people than just my boyfriend and I. It would really be a treat to go with several people and pick a few fish and all share them family style! The fried calamari dish was absolutely divine and they have a great wine selection to accompany their delectable food! MmmMmmMmm!

   Don't get ripped off. Fish basically a bland food, tastes like cardboard. You've got to do somethng to it to get flavor. Here, they add olive oil and lemon.and.... nothing! Or I should say a very high price nothing. Our ballata fish was about $50/lb for a 3 pound fish. We (4 of us) got about 5 ounces each and the same amount from a black sea bass, @$34/lb.The appetizers were excellent. The fried zuchini chips and cheese was superb as were the shrimp. The carbonated water is, are you ready?, nine bucks a bottle.

   TERRIBLE SERVICE. My wife and I live in Bay Ridge and dine out in the neighborhood often. We were looking forward to checking out the newly expanded Cebu. We arrived early for dinner and were seated in the back room. After about ten minutes I stepped into the bar and asked a busboy if the waiter was aware that we were in the back (we were the only ones in the room). He said that he would let the waiter know. The waitress came to the table about five minutes later. She was rude. When we got the bill we had been charged double for a drink. When I pointed it out, she brought it back to the bar and blamed the mistake on a faulty computer. We will not be going back to Cebu.",Cebu,15-Nov-09,Neil

   Opps. Four friends went to dinner there the other day, not only did we feel rushed, but when we finished our dinner and asked to have another round, we were told we had to leave that they needed the table. There were three empty tables next to us. Then to add insult to evening they tacked on a 20% gratuity, which is usually done with parties of 6 or 8 at all restuarants.

"I really enjoyed my week's holiday in New York, and as one might expect the food played a large part in that. Rather than do loads of blog posts (I really can't be arsed nowadays) here's a round-up of some of my favourite eats in the Big Apple. The dimly-lit dining room at Minetta Tavern , while terrible for food photography, is one of the most buzzy, atmospheric ones I've eaten in. And I've eaten in a lot. I kicked off with a generous portion of roasted bone marrow served with shallot confit and baguette soldiers while my friend went with roast baby beets . Both got the thumbs up. For mains, we both ordered the legendary Black Label burger . Made with prime cuts of dry-aged beef, topped with caramelized onions and served in a sesame-topped brioche bun, this was without doubt the best burger I've ever eaten. Oh, and the big mountain of fries were bloody amazing, too. Overall, Minetta Tavern was probably my favourite out of all the restaurants I visited in New York. This begs the questi ...

Dad is all into Tribeca Grill because DeNiro is an owner; he's been there at least twice before. GF was paying for dinner, and is a picky eater, so it was strange that Dad asked me to make restaurant suggestions.

With Valentine's falling on a Monday, Mike and I decided to change things around a bit and made a reservation for Sunday night, allowing us to take our time and get more bang out of our gift certificate buck (the actual Valentine's Night prix-fixe was almost double what we ended up paying for our meal). Since this was an evening for Mike and I to just enjoy, I didn't take any pictures, but I did want to write a little something to express how happy I was with this meal.

  The Smith is one of the more popular of the generation of NYC restaurants that evolved out of the speakeasy scene. Lots of cocktails and lots of wood contrast with the industrial lamps and white tile walls. It's like eating on a renovated subway platform from the 1940s. The place, at 7 on a weekend, was crowded, but not such that I wasn't able to get a reservation or find a spot at the bar to wait for my friends. It's a little loud and the food is standard American comfort food, by and large. Burgers, pot pie, mac and cheese - standard gastropub; no groundbreaking menus here - so maybe it shouldn't be a shock that there were a fair number of kids. I guess that if mom and dad want a drink, and the kids want a burger, and nobody wants boring, The Smith is a pretty good choice. ...

Both the fried and steamed dumplings were Tops. (the steamed ones were mouth watering). The hot n sour soup was okay nothing great. Cold Sesame noodles were perfect. The peanut butter topping wasn't too thick. The ribs were off the CHART! Meaty, no fat, crisp with an absolutely mouth wathering sauce which allows you to eat alot. We were doubtful comining in but their ribs are #1. You're in Pig Heaven!",Nancy Lee's Pig Heaven,2-Aug-10,Cymru132

   Brings back fond memories of childhood. Since I was four, 20 years ago, I have been coming to this place. The walls used to be lined with hundreds of wooden pink pigs on a ledge. Since then the place has undergone some changes to give it more appeal, but the food has not. The scallion pancakes appetizer here is bar none the best I have ever had and that has not changed. The Szechwan dumplings are a spicy delight. The general tso's chicken, the three glass chicken, the firecracker shrimp, the peking duck, the wonton soup are all spectacular. And for the adventurous eater there are many options that are more authentic to the restaurant's chinese roots. I love, love, love this place. And their delivery service is the fastest I have ever seen in the city.",Nancy Lee's Pig Heaven,27-Jul-10,Ira Namarathon

"Disappointing. Curiosity of Anthony Bourdain's episode on New York City led me to this restaurant where I was severely disappointed. Pig Heaven did not do justice to their rendition of roast suckling pig. It was microwaved and yielded rubbery skin.

   I am not coming back... Not worth the money.

the line was too long, the place was too small, we couldnt find a place to sit. The meals are overpriced. and a bucket of 6 pcs of chicken was for how much???

Just because I wanted to taste what I've always had back home, i tried it and took it back to our place. The Palabok didnt have much taste to it besides just being way too salty. I've had better chicken at a really bad chicken place with their chicken joy, sauce was very similar to what they serve back in the Philippines though.

  In a city overflowing with Italian specialty restaurants, Trattoria Dell'Arte stands out as an inviting place to enjoy outstanding food in a wonderful atmosphere. Even though the restaurant was at capacity, the noise level did not detract from the experience. The Pesto Ravioli Alla Brando was spectacular as was the Chicken Pepperoni Parmigiana. For the One Hundred and One Layer Lasagne, there was a bite to the sauce we could not figure out, even after discussing it with the wait staff.

  We have had many, many meals at Trattoria over the last 25 years.  Never a bad meal, never a just-OK meal, always great food and great service!  Word of advice:  the cannolis are addictive!  Wine list is extensive, waiters are knowledgeable, the ambiance is great and food always wonderful.  In the summer time one can sit outside and enjoy a cool, crisp drink.  During your meal don't be surprised if waiters come around with complimentary fresh out-of-the-oven chocolate chip cookies.    They are also great for parties and have a separate party room downstairs for larger parties.  We've had birthday parties, my husband had his bachelor's party 20+ years ago, engagement party, etc.  Overall a great experience. We enjoy it every single time we go.",Trattoria Dell'Arte,11-Jun-15,Cornelia Krieger

   Ok, but for a type. I thought that New York had grown out of the stereotypical Italian restaurant where meatballs, parmigiana and cannoli featured heavily, especially in midtown and at this price range. Instead I discovered it has not. Trattoria dell'Arte is just such a place. Food is well prepared and efficiently ordered in a well rehearsed sort of way. The atmosphere is lively given the large full dining room. But the menu is uninspiring and a bit stale reminiscent of successful Italian restaurants of past. You almost expect the table cloths to have red and White checks. Good place if that is what you are going for.",Trattoria Dell'Arte,28-Aug-12,Andrea

   We had the most fabulous Italian meal last night in NYC at Trattoria Dell'Arte. Soooo good. The almond crust cannoli made a grown man in our party cry, and the ice cream torta made a woman in our party cry. Sausage and peppers, meatballs, various seafood and vegetable antipasti appetizers, the wine, the waiter, all fabulous. Gigantic rustic thin-crust pizzas. Great meats and sauces. And they took us, a surprise party of 7, in as walk-ins on a busy Saturday night and seated us promptly and with humor. They did twice forget or bring the wrong dishes, but we didn't mind, everyone was in such good spirits, and the things they did bring by mistake ended up being awesome as well. They own two new Italian restaurants in Washington DC's National Harbor that we want to try - Bond 45 and Fiorella - and also own several other restaurants in NYC - The Redeye, Cafe Fiorello, and Brooklyn Diner.",Trattoria Dell'Arte,4-Dec-11,Levinson_k

I had requested a table in the front when I made the reservation. But when I arrived I was shown to the last table --right at the kitchen's door. The maitre d' insisted that it was a great table, which added insult to injury. The waiter was rude and I didn't recognize the food from times past, it was so inferior,The pizza looked old. It was also cold. Add all this to the price-- $400 for three (a salad, a pizza, a dessert, two of the lowest price bottles of wine)--and it made for an extremely disappointing experience.

I have eaten several meals here including breakfast. I like bringing guests here so when a friend was in town we had dinner here and she was thrilled with the flavors. We shared the winter insalata which had bitter greens, hazelnuts, dried cheeries and complimented the saltiness of the speck. Then it was onto My Grandmother's Ravioli with a side of Brussels sprouts. I confess that I preferred the desserts when Karen DeMasco created them.

  Locanda Verde is Robert De Niro’s comeback restaurant after the dismal failure of Ago, which formerly occupied this space.

This “Green Inn”, is Andrew Carmellini’s newest undertaking, where he has created a seasonal market leaning menu. Unlike his previous acts at Café Boulud and A Voce, Locanda Verde is a simpler Italian tavern with home-style dishes.

Carmellini’s kitchen turns out knockout food without much fuss. Just try their sheep’s-milk ricotta or the lamb meatball sliders. Any dish that involves bread is a winner (try the crostini) and the desserts are decadent delights too.

It’s no wonder that Locanda Verde is being hailed as one of the hottest new restaurants in Tribeca.

"It's high time that we discuss the exquisite joy that is pastry-eating at Locanda Verde in NYC. I've been excited to visit this place for a long time, for three main reasons: My customer-turned buddy too, Kelly Fink, works there as a baker. A few visits ago, Ed Levine of Serious Eats said that their sweets could not be missed. You listen to a guy like this. They have homemade pastries. Really, while #1 and #2 sweeten the deal, #3 alone would have brought me to this place. yes, looking this good DOES hurt sometimes. So. After arriving in a mild-hurricane state (I had a train to catch, to visit another bakery, in 20 minutes, natch), I was able to quickly give Kelly a hug and nab a cinnamon sugar doughnut and an espresso chocolate scone. Basically, then I had to run. But that was not the end of my Locanda Verde nirvana. First, the scone. Dense, biscuity, and extremely moist, it was studded with little landmines of warm, lightly gooey bittersweet chocolate and nibbly little bits of espress ...

Featuring a house infused jalapeño vodka and a proprietary bloody mix, I found myself mentally preparing to have my tongue a bit singed. When presented with my beverage, I noted the small bits of horseradish suspended in the liquid matrix. It appeared that this particular concoction used a smaller amount of horseradish, though more finely chopped than I usually find. While this slightly allayed my spice burn fears, I was still concerned about the effects of the infused jalapeño....Upon my first sip, however, I found the Inferno Bloody Mary to be, well, lacking an inferno.

   OK but will not be back. Decent enough food but I found the waitstaff behaviour to be a bit sketchy. I had two items added to my tab after I handed over my credit card. I didn't sign until they removed the items. I guess they figured I was a tourist rube who wouldn't be checking the charges.
I frankly don't put up with crap like this. Either the management knows about this kind of stuff and allows it or they don't in which case they are idiots.

   Suffering from identify crisis?. I really enjoyed the food here, in a city that seems to mainly serve brunch on Saturdays and Sundays, I was hanging for a mid week brunch feast. We ordered the cinnamon waffle and the french toast, topped with a half order of pancakes (why not). The food was tasty and plentyful. The crowd was a mixed bag and the bar was buzzing even at midday. I was curious as to what this place wants to be......a hip diner, a quantity not quality diner, fine food.......who knows, but they have such a following I suspect they don't care.",Cafeteria,15-Oct-11,Monique Henderson

   Good Food, Fraudulent Charges. It's a mixed bag. The food is good and the scene vibrant, but the chaos has its downside, too. More than once, I've had items on my check that were never ordered or served. The last time, it was $60 from the bar, when we ordered nothing from the bar at all. My fault for signing the credit card receipt, but theirs for adding the items and not catching it when the bill was presented. Management refused even to split the difference and then lied, saying it was impossible to refund anything to the card. I'll never eat there again. Not saying you shouldn't, but check your bill and realize you're dealing with sleazy management.",Cafeteria,2-Aug-11,WSP

The last time we saw each other was in JFK while she was waiting for a connecting flight! I gave her a few options in terms of restaurants and she selected Cafeteria. I have only been to their former location in Miami so I wasn’t sure what to expect. It was live in there but the music was a little too loud for my liking. The place is open 24/7 which is a plus. The menu had a lot of options but for whatever reason there was nothing that really called out to me. The complimentary biscuits were incredible.

   MACARONI. Cafeteria is an interesting place...it aims at being trendier and sophisticated than it really is.

The food is also for the most part very average, however their macaroni is definitely in the top 5 in NYC.

   Mac Attack!!!. The only restaurant with a bouncer and a line winding longer than the clubs next door. What's all the fuss about?

"Great food - Service sucks.. The meatloaf and mac and cheese are incredible.. The atmosphere is cool and casual, busy, but not too noisy. Fun place, the only drawback is the service. Unless you are friends of someone that works there, they really try and rush you in and out, and are somewhat bothered by waiting on you. For the $$, I like to enjoy my dinner, please don't rush me. I'm sorry I'm not a movie star, but I do have $ and tip well if you treat me right..
Overall, the food and atmosphere outweigh the bad service, and maybe if you're lucky, you'll get a good waiter.. I frequent this restaurant in moderation, but would go more, if staff were nicer.

   Being a sothern boy myself, I was pleased to see that they had chicken and waffles. The chicken was good by most standards, but the waffle, the waffle was to die for.

   My go-to place. I am a cafeteria fan.
You CANNOT beat the VEGAN veggie burger for only $10!!

  I had the misfortune of falling for Nobu's notorious P.R. hype. From all the puffery, one would think this restaurant is the second coming of Sukiyabashi Jiro. Well, perhaps the second coming of Panda Express, but anything better would be a large stretch of the culinary imagination.

I'm so disappointed with Nobu that I'm not going to waste words or time on this review. Suffice it to say that I found the quality of the fish lacking. The chefs here don't even have the good sense of someone such as Seki from Sushi Seki to disguise the lack of freshness.

The pretentious snobbery here is ridiculous. Note to servers, I may not be Robert DeNiro (this restaurant's co-founder), but last time I checked my money is as good as his.

"New York's original Nobu is located in Tribeca on the corner of Hudson and Franklin Sts., and is the flagship restaurant of Chef Nobu Matsuhisa. Having opened in 1994 the restaurant has been a pioneer in Asian-fusion cuisine, particularly in the now widespread Japanese-Peruvian style of cooking, and has spread to include over twenty locations worldwide. With investors such as restaurateur Drew Nieporent (of Tribeca Grill, Corton, and Centrico) and actor Robert De Niro (who first became acquainted with Chef Matsuhisa at his Matsuhisa restaurant in LA), Nobu's success was almost guaranteed from the beginning. Seventeen years later the restaurant still ranks among New York's finest; and while it might not be as trendy as it once was, Nobu Tribeca still retains both its allure and popularity. The design of the restaurant is meant to evoke the tranquility of the Japanese countryside. Earth tone paints, wooden columns in the shape of trees, and natural wood tables make for a much less modern ...

   Original is Best. Being a fan of Melbourne Nobu, of course I must visit New York whilst I am here...Upon entrance our jackets are taken and we are escorted promptly to our table. The surroundings are amazing. The waiter is so friendly and polite, I want to bring him back to Melbourne Nobu. I ask for a beef wagyu dish similar to the one in Melbourne - the waiter doesn't know what it is - so he says he will call Melbourne and ask - right now! I decline profusely, saying it's not that important, waiter insists it is no trouble. He returns shortly, advising us that the wagyu beef dish is being prepared as we speak - to the Melbourne recipe. I am absolutely floored and speechless. The food is amazing and lives up to the hype - I am only too happy to pay whatever the bill says - I have just had an unforgettable experience in an amazing city.",Nobu,19-Feb-11,Tav

   # 1 Japenese in NYC. Aside from the original Matsuhisa on La Cienaga in Los Angeles, I have been to two on Hudson in New York City--Nobu New York City and Nobu Next Door.In typical Japanese sushi bar fashion, the best way to experience the entrees is to order omakase (omakase means trust in Japanese), entrusting your taste buds to the chef. The dishes are designed to come out from cold to hot with a sushi sampler arriving last followed by dessert. My favorites are: black cod with miso, yellowtail with jalapeno, rock shrimp tempura with ponzu (the creamy spicy sauce lacks kick), wagyu beef, Arctic charr with crispy baby spinach, and the sashimi salad. As for service, it is impeccable. The servers are courteous, discreet, and nothing but smiles.

   How could it be so good?. I totally assumed that this would be a tourist trap, since it's situated right across from Lincoln Center with its sidewalk cafe always crowded. Well you can definitely spend a LOT of money there if you want. But it's well spent. You can also have a selection of three absolutely delicious appetizers for $15. Not a bad deal even at dinner. Except that once you see the appetizers (sorry - they are called something else. Not tapas, because this is Italian) you want to have more, and to include some of the ones containing fish. My favorites - caramelized fennel, bufalo mozzerelo, swiss chard with pine nuts, grilled octopus, beets with oranges, grilled veggies, calamari salad, smoked salmon rolls wrapped in cucumber.

   Love this place. Awesome mix of Euro transplants, ladies who lunch, neighborhood moguls, and hedge fund managers. No reservations. Arrive for lunch at noon; at 12:15 the French maitre d' will look at the empty tables, look back at you, and say ""I do not have it!""

  I've had Candle 79 bookmarked for over two years and it was worth the wait! I loved the causal feel yet of this restaurant. The restaurant was a bit dark inside, definitely a place where you can enjoy a dinner date, it wasn't loud, and there wasn't a lot of people when I went with a friend mid-week for dinner. The patrons were a mix of late 30s to 50s so it was a good mix of people. It didn't feel at all pretentious despite being in UES. The staff was friendly and helpful with helping us decide what to order. I tried the crepe which was amazing. Everything came well together. Portions were perfect. We ended up eating our entire plate and had no room to share. It says a lot that they wowed a non-vegan friend with their spaghetti and meatballs. Their food is tasty. I would highly recommend it. Definitely coming back again, on my list of good vegan restaurants!",Candle 79,11 months ago,Xtine

  This is the place to visit for a high end, gourmet vegan experience. The presentation is so beautiful! It was a pity the lighting was dim, so the photos don't do justice to the dishes.

Taste wise, some dishes didn't do much for me but the others were quite delicious. The desserts, especially the chocolate mousse, blew me away. Each bite was pure bliss!

The service was pretty good.

  While looking up places to eat in New York, I came across Candle 79. Even though I am not vegan, I wanted to try a vegan place because it’s really nice and relaxing to walk in to a restaurant and not have to stress over whether something contains dairy in it or not. As well, Candle 79 had really great reviews, so how could I pass it up? So, after an afternoon of exploring Central Park and The Met museum, we explored the Upper East Side and went to Candle 79! ...

My wife had the ravioli to start - morel and romp - it was so delicious. I had the vegetable empanadas, which were very flavourful. The pastry was perfect, and the guacamole, vegan sour cream and salsa were the perfect accompaniments. For the mains, my wife had the wild mushroom crepes and I had the seitin piccata.

It was a big sandwich especially for a big city.  The price was about on par with what I’d expect from city restaurants. But, oh boy, was it delicious. I’d eat there every day if I could. It doesn’t seem like the cleanest place.  It is well light especially for being there at night.  The corwd wasn’t so bad.  As I said the place is big and I handle myself well being in crowds.

  The best sandwich I have had!! The deli is a relic, it has a canteen style dining hall with walls covered in pictures of all the celebrities that have graced it's doors. This is where that scene in ""Where Harry met Sally"" was shot. ""I'll have what she's having"". It has been family run for over 100 years!
The choices are extensive and a little pricey but it's all worth it.
The meat is magical and truly melts in your mouth. Here is why;
""Our corned beef and pastrami is cured using a slower method, which best flavors the meat, without injecting chemicals, water, or other additives to speed the process. Our finished product can take up to a full 30 days to cure, while commercially prepared corned beef is often pressure-injected (or “pumped”) to cure in 36 hours. Yep, you read that right. 30 days vs. 36 hours.""

Their ordering system is a little confusing but we pretty much caught on. When we got to the counter we ordered a corned beef and a pastrami sandwich to go. During our wait we were served samples of the meat we chose. My goodness the sandwiches were ginormous! One sandwich is probably good for 2 people. Sandwiches are about $20 each but worth it. We ate them when we got back to our hotel and it was still warm and delish. I had to save one half for later and it was just as good. The pickles and cucumbers add an extra touch.

  Famous Dave took us the Famous Katz - and as expected there were six queues for the pastrami sandwiches- which would've taken far too long to include in our food tour. But Dave suggested we try the garlic sausage hot dog on baked bread, and it was delicious- we especially loved the mustard.

  If it wasn't for the incredibly confusing and chaotic ordering process, I would have given this place a much higher rating. We tried the pastrami sandwich on rye. It was pretty steep at $20 but the portion was big enough to almost feed two. The meat was super tender and the mustard spread made a great pairing.
With that said, I honestly don't understand why they can't hire a better door person who can just quickly explain how the ordering works. 
Basically, once you walk in, you will get a blank ticket. Then you go up to the counters marked ""for ordering sandwiches"" and make your order. The sandwich maker will then bring out a plate with a couple slices of meat for you to taste while he assembles the sandwhich. Then he asks for your ticket to write the price of your order on it. You then go and eat at any of the ""non-waited"" tables and pay at the door when you leave by showing them your ticket.

  Of course it's a little dirty and the door staff are gruff - that adds to the experience. Sometimes the counter guys are in a mood and will yell at you - others are exceptionally nice. The food is pricey but it's totally worth it. My tip would be to get yourself a  sandwich and try to eat that before ordering more food like a knish or fries. I have made the mistake of getting a sandwich and fries all at once and after my sandwich realizing I can't touch anything else. Getting just a sandwich will fill you up and keep your bill manageable.

  When we started telling people about our New York holiday, we were inundated with recommendations for places to eat. Everyone who’s been there has their favourites, and are very passionate about them. My list became so long and unmanageable that I scrapped it – twice – and in the end just decided to work it out it when we arrived, on the assumption that there would be probably be plenty of great places wherever we ended up.

  Overpriced tourist trap.

I went there on a reco from friends and paid about $15 USD for a simple pastrami on rye - no fries, no drink, nothing else.

I've had better here in Toronto (Centre St. Deli) and in Montreal (Schwartz) so it's hard for me to give this more than a 3.5 in terms of value for money.

The sandwich was good but this is a tourist trap through and through. I'm not entirely familiar with the NYC area but I'd look around.

I hear great thing about most the food, but I've only has the corned beef and the pastrami. Not a great fan of the corned beef in general, but the pastrami is off the hook. You can have it mixed with the beef, add swiss cheese, chop liver or whatever.

  Katz Delicatessen is one of the foremost staples of all things New York. It's quick, if you're not quick and orderly you will get hammered by a 50 dollar lost ticket fee, and it's simply amazing.
I ordered the Reuben sandwich and was surprised to see how high the cost for a sandwich was ($20 on average). Then I saw the size of the meaty behemoth and quickly changed my tune. Not only do they give you a decent sized plate of pickles and cucumber, but they give you a taste of the meat before you get your sandwich. It was an epiphany in the preparation of pastrami. Those are words I never thought to be written.
I came THIS close to reacting much like Sally did here in my favorite movie When Harry Met Sally.

They each add to your paper what you owe. You then take the items to a table ( but not the server tables - which we didn't know existed until we sat in the wrong place with our tray) You even have to get your own glass of water.

   Expensive and mediocre. My former NYer husband and I hit Katz's last night on the city. We were looking forward to the classic deli food. He ordered the corned beef sandwich ($19!) which came cold, sliced thick and fatty. I ordered the tuna ($13), soggy chunk light. I paid $5.50 for slaw, so runny, white goo slopped over the plate. Also a knish, that was frozen and then microwaved into basically a ball of mashed potatoes.

The best part of the meal was the pickles, mustard, and the Dr Brown's ($2.75 a can!), none of which is made at the deli.

We came in, dropped $50 for two sandwiches, and we can say we're over the Katz's experience.",Katz's Delicatessen,19-Mar-15,Lisa Mann
"The last place we dined at during our short, but enjoyable trip to the Big Apple was at Katz's Deli. Of all of the food landmarks that New York City is home to, there's no doubt that the 125-year-old Katz's is quite possibly the most famous one around! People travel from abroad to experience what Katz's has to offer and both locals and tourists alike love this place enough to keep the lines going out the doors on a daily basis. Luckily on the day of our visit, we came in at just the right time and waited no more than ten minutes for our sandwich.

Although they were always busy, we could always muster up the strength to wait for a table, especially with the aroma of a fine delicatessen wafted through the air. I went back years later after moving out of state. I could swear that everything was almost the same, including some of the workers. I understand why they won first place for their pastrami sandwich.

   Pastrami Reuben and Matzo ball soup. The sandwich was ok. Not as good as Carnegie Deli's Pastrami Reuben but more reasonably priced. Matzo ball soup was good. It was the 1st time I have ever had it so I have nothing to compare it to but I would order it again. We waited in line for at least 30 minutes because each person in front of us ordered multiple sandwiches. It was chaotic, busy and confusing. Have to go in 1 line to order a sandwich, then another line to order drinks or side items and the have to wait again to find an empty table. I only say 1 of the sandwich guys with a smile. The rest looked like they were having a miserable day. I would eat there again if I happened to be in the neighborhood but would not make a special trip to go there.

The next day I was sure to arrive early and grab my ticket thus making sure I'd get to experience this institution.

The process is easy enough..take your ticket and approach the sandwich maker who will give you a sample of the pastrami, give him a tip and then tell him what you'd like. Then move down the line to the drinks and finally the desserts...then go find yourself a seat and gorge yourself silly on the finest sandwich you'll eat.

   Nothing to get excited about. Today was the day I got to experience the famous Katz deli. After a convoluted seating and ticket process we sat down and ordered 3x pastrami sandwiches a cheeseburger and fries. The start was fantastic with some wonderful pickles that we the appetite, then after a short wait the sandwiches and burger came out. I'm not sure what i was expecting but the pastrami on rye was underwhelming and didn't pack the punch I was going for. The bread was ok and I think would benefit from some light sauce or even a grilling. The pastrami itself was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth but just didn't have the bags of flavour I was reaching for. The fries on the other hand were really nice and lifted the meal. To summarize I'm a little unsure why Katz is so huge when they only offer good sandwiches not amazing ones. It's a once only trip to put a tick in the box, but $20 inc tax etc for a god damn sanga is just nuts.

"Founded in 1888, by a Russian immigrant family, Katz’s deli, at 205 East Houston Street is truly a New York Landmark. True delicatessens are real and rare, because they continue a tradition of meat preparation and preservation predating refrigeration. In the early part of the twentieth century, the Lower East Side was home to millions of the newly emigrated. This was a time long before smoking, pickling and other curing methods of prolonging the life of food had been perfected. This is the classic, Jewish, kosher-style, New York deli. While pondering the menu, you may notice words in Yiddish, the only language many European immigrants spoke when they arrived in this country. While arguably the best hot dog in the city, serving 12,000 per week, they also plate up 5,000 pounds of corned beef and 2,000 pounds ...

"It’s been nearly a year since we were in New York and I still haven’t written about Ippudo or Katz. Disgraceful. Shame on me as these were the two places we really wanted to eat at, and I’m glad we did as they lived up to expectations.   Does Katz really need any introduction, it seems to have been blogged about a million times. It’s a regular on TV from Man v Food, Tony Bourdain and even on films, yeah we know which one. This is the benchmark for all New York Deli’s and apart from Russ and Daughters, which we never got to try sadly, this is probably the most popular deli in the world. You can either do table service along the side walls or queue and risk trying to get a seat, which could be difficult as Katz is always full and I mean full. Now you could say that when a joint has so much publicity its either a PR department on overdrive or there is actually some truth in it and every journo, film crew are just jumping on the bandwagon. ...

"Katz’s Deli has been around forever (since 1888) and they do meat and bread and pickles. You can get a variety on that combination, but that is essentially the gist of it (sorry vegetarians, although there soups and salads…). For meat you have a choice of corned beef, pastrami or brisket and with or without mustard (with of course). Pickles on the side. The meats sit in huge slow roasting barbecues, the pastrami just oozes with this homely smokiness, succulently pink and juicy. The corned beef has a secret dry rub that’s left to cure for a month. The result is a deliciously subtle flavour and a buttery texture of perfectly cooked meat. They carve it up on the spot for you and slap it in between two thick slices of bread. Done. That’s it.

   Legendary and great food, but pricey. Katz's is a New York City legend and deservedly so. All the food I've ever had there is great. The pastrami and roast beef are excellent.

If you go, keep in mind that the prices are relatively high (maybe not by NYC standards). For a party of two, expect to spend $50. (Of course, in most of America, two can have the same menu for $30-35.)",Katz's Delicatessen,27-Jun-12,Tony

You gotta be kiddin’ me!” But you should probably plan to split it or come with an athlete’s appetite, because the pastrami sandwich here comes loaded with what seems like a solid pound of succulent meat. Smooth, moist, thick-cut and perfectly salted – THIS is pastrami! Plus they give you an entire cucumber AND and entire pickle (quartered, of course) – so all in all it even turns out to be pretty decent value! ...

   Great Pastrami San.... Really enjoyed our experience here! Great juicy hot pastrami sand.... Don't forget where you put your ticket however! We put everything on my friends ticket and I paid the bill. I didn't realize I would need it when leaving. After showing the 3rd security guard who detained and questioned me my recpt for our 2 lunches that proved I payed 100 bucks for lunch for two, I said:""look, I apologize for not payin attention when we walked in, but really...how much could the 2 of us possibly have eaten more than the 100 bucks i just spent for our 2 meals and all we ordered?""

   Hot dogs to go. Katz's is famous for it's carved deli meats. One of the great items on the menu is their frankfurters.

There was no waiting at the hot dog station. I picked up two to go and ate them on line. They were tasty with the right amount of snap.

Other than the hot open-faced turkey, roast beef, or brisket sandwich plates, which come with a choice of 2 sides (our of steak fries, potato salad, cole slaw, macaroni, and beans), the sandwiches do not come with any sides (unless you count a pickle).

"Let's not beat around the bush: Katz's is definitely a tourist destination, but cannot be described as a trap because the food here is the real deal. It is the type of place you need to try at least once, for the perfect Jewish delicatessen pastrami sandwich. Meat preparation was different before refrigeration and you get a taste of how things were for the better in years past. Be prepared here, have your order and money ready, and make sure to tip the guys or you will receive a smaller sandwich than the people at the next table. It's just how it works. And don't be intimidated by that sporadic Yiddish on the menu, that's just for fun and preserving the past. The Katz's pastrami will set you back $15.75, but is more than enough food for two people.

   The Original Jewish Happy Meal!!!. For lunch, we head over to the Lower East Side to the legendary Katz's Delicatessen where the food is so good… it makes New Yorkers stop talking/whining (during lunch).

It's also home to Meg Ryan's famous fake-orgasm scene but for those of us who have ever had their Roast Beef sandwich and Potato Latkes knows… she wasn't faking it.

Our server could not have been nicer, and for that I will rate this a ""like"" rather than ""dislike.""

   Lean pastrami Reuben is to die for!. We finally made it to Katz's Deli this year, after previously trying both Stage Deli and Carnegie Deli. After biting into our sandwich, it was Katz's for the win.

We ordered a lean pastrami Reuben, Matzo ball soup and half-sour pickles. The taste of pastrami was fantastic and I couldn't wait for the sandwich to be built. Once we gathered our order we sat at a table several down from the one made famous in When Harry Met Sally and chowed down. The Reuben was a.ma.zing. Truly spectacular...so much better than both Stage and Carnegie that it wasn't even like comparing apples to apples.

Carnegie, however, won on the Matzo ball soup. The soup at Katz's was missing the intense chicken flavor of Carnegie, so Carnegie won the soup round.

To give you a better idea, we were plotting how to get more Reubens delivered from Katz's to Seattle as we're only in NYC about once a year. We already miss that darn sandwich.",Katz's Delicatessen,8-Feb-11,Thetripchick

My short and sweet recap: good corned beef, horrible cole slaw (tasted like Miracle Whip), decent grilled cheese (although after two attempts by my lovely companion after asking for a grilled Swiss on Rye she got mystery orange cheese on white, then mystery white on rye). Folks who seem like they hate their jobs..slice of life. Side note: unconfirmed sighting of Jon Vogt eating with some straggly looking folks. If it was him he a) has quite a belly on him 2) needs to reheel his cowboy boots",Katz's Delicatessen,21-Nov-10,Foodie Petoodie

"POSITIVE
   Out of towner not disappointed. I grew up a foodie, and watching Katz's Deli on the the TV (Food Network, Travel Channel) I was super excited to finally try it. In fact, I went twice in one trip, making two meals out each sandwich! A little bit of Americana in my opinion.

The tongue sandwich was great, with a little pastrami. Feeling adventurous, you should try it. It's not as crazy as it sounds. The guys behind the counter were cool too. Had a little chat with them while I watched him cut it to order.

Piece of advice--that tip cup is not there for nothing. Use it. And I suggest you tip before they make your sandwich. Just do it.",Katz's Delicatessen,5-Nov-10,ONI

   This is a novelty tourist trap, not a good place for a sandwich. Plus, you'll wait to pay at the register up front only to find that you have to go to the back of the restaurant.

   Don't fall for it. We came here on a mission to try a real NY deli. If this is it - I am disappointed. It wasn't easy to get to so we opted for the waiter service over the counter. We sat at a recently vacated table and awaited a busser or waiter. Neither came and after a move to another table we finally got acknowledged. We ordered a pitcher of beer, a Reuben with extra Russian dressing and a frankfurter with everything. The beer came first, then the pickles, the Reuben -minus the extra dressing and then several minutes later the frankfurter. Overall - we've had much better food and I guess we should have ordered at the counter. We felt the server was just annoyed by us. The check for this feast was $50 - really?",Katz's Delicatessen,8-Sep-10,Kellyhende
"POSITIVE
   All killer, no filler.. Katz's is an institution. For my first trip there, was there really anything I could get but the pastrami? The answer of course is a resounding ""no,"" and for good reason.

Katz's pastrami sandwiches bring the heat. They take this stuff as seriously as us southerners take our bbq pork. The pastrami itself is so tender that it literally melts in your mouth. On rye and slathered with a copious amount of mustard and a mountain of meat, this sandwich is one for the ages, and a perfect hangover cure after a night on the town. Steak fries on the side might have been a bit much but they were right on point. My buddy's knish was solid as well. I also really liked the lightly pickled cucumbers on the side.

The service is great here, too. The guys making your sandwiches do it with a smile, and the owner still makes his rounds to check on the patrons. A lot of hospitality and a mound of comfort food make Katz's a sure thing.",Katz's Delicatessen,20-Aug-10,Charlie

Katz's is in/out get your ticket, get it signed, eat everything in site from the knishes, to the reubens, the potato salad, the best kosher pickles, and of course duh,,, matzo ball soup.

   Good Turkey Sandwiches. We usually go to Katz's at least once a year. It is not somewhere we go often, but a treat when we do. When you go inside they will give you a ticket. DO NOT LOSE this ticket or it will cost you. This ticket is where the carver will write your order. I usually get the Turkey on a roll with swiss cheese and tomato. You get to watch the carver make your sandwich right in front of your eyes. Then you get to choose which kind of pickles you want. My turkey has always been warm, moist and delicious. I have never gotten a bad sandwich here. Plus, they are HUGE. There is at least enough for 2 servings here. Overall, we have had great experiences with Katz's and I would visit again.

   You Let me down. Last week while visiting NYC some relatives and I decided to visit our old haunt Katz's Deli for a nosh. Although the ambiance has been maintained over generations, the food seems to have changed and not for the better. I ordered my Fave…Matzo ball soup and a half Coned Beef Sandwich. Much to my disappointment the Matzo Ball was all busted up. It did not live up to its colorful description in the menu. Although the sandwich was piled customarily high with meat….it was so dry I could have used it to absorb my entire cup of soup. Possibly this was an off day last Monday 10/24 about 7pm.

If you get a little chilly, they even have these soft, fluffy red blankets for you so you can get cozy. Only thing is the server kept coming over to ask us whether we needed refills when we hadn't even finished our first drink. Other than that, I really enjoyed this place and had a lovely time with friends!

  This rooftop has a captive special place in my heart since the times I was an NYU student! Awesome for rooftopping on a warm sunset session, to enjoy a weekend late brunch with friends, and in a cold winter night visit for the heated ""230 mood"" with some stylish red robes and hot cider in your hands, and one thing is for sure: no matter the time of the day nor the season, 230 never disappoints, quality/cost/location/view shows as one of the most competitive in the city.",230 Fifth,11 months ago,Ana Pipa Gonçalves

  230 Fifth is an enclosed, penthouse lounge in NoMad! The views at 230 Fifth are simply breathtaking. Trust me, you won’t be disappointed if only going here to get a glimpse of the view. 230 Fifth gets packed after 8pm, so I suggest getting there early if you want a seat.  If you are lucky to get a seat, then you should definitely order some food. I suggest ordering the Mac & Cheese and some Sliders. The drinks are also pretty good and in my opinion not watered down. ...

The food really depends on the dish, I love the Short Rib Beef Rendang. and the Calamari It is absolutely delicious. You can even have an enjoyable brunch here. And their menu is huge and simple. The view is incredible. and could really make a good night/weekend.

I abhor having to struggle with waitstaff over a 10 minute issue when all it would have taken was some level of courtesy to take our order and have it cooked first up when the kitchen changed.

"Just over a year ago, a Staten Island specialty (complete with one of its most famous namesakes) was ferried to Manhattan in the form of Rubirosa. Setting up shop in Nolita, across the street from Torrisi Italian Specialties, together they've established a bastion of neo-classic Italian cuisine along the edge of the less-than-classics of Little Italy, just a block away. Despite high expectations (especially for the pizza), I've yet to be disappointed with anything I've eaten on numerous lunchtime visits. Arancini comes extra cheesy, filled with mascarpone, prosciutto and fontina. The wedge salad, meanwhile, is served with a couple strips of bacon, vodka blue cheese dressing and a scattering cherry tomatoes. Call me old fashioned, but I like my wedges drenched in blue cheese dressing. Even so, this rendition of the classic is a smart way to start your meal.

Thus, what a surprise it was to discover instead a warm, convivial and family-friendly neighborhood establishment that appears to be rabidly popular with trendy young things, neighborhood families, traveling foodies, singles, and couples alike. A cheery blood orange and crimson facade with a retro painted sign announce Rubirosa's presence. The pizzeria's space on a Mulberry street block shared by Balaboosta, Eight Mile Creek, and Torrisi Italian Specialties is narrow and quirky.

   The service is great, as advertised. But they try a little too hard and can make you feel a little claustrophobic. The tables are also very close together. The food is good and there are celebrities to see.

It was more difficult for me to say ""like it"" to this restaurant than it should have been. Mainly because of how seriously the restaurant takes itself. It is classically French, but there are other, more fun, more comfortable, less expensive French restaurants that are as good (or better) unless fashionable.",La Grenouille,16-Mar-14,Brent Byers

   Nearly flawless. My wife and I ate at Le Grenouille for the first time last week. When we walked in, we were immediately struck by the beauty of the room, and especially the amazing flowers. The lobster ravoli was amazing, as was my salad. My wife had the chicken, which was very, very good. I had the frog legs, which were the best I've ever eaten. The cheese plate was delightful. The staff were friendly, knowledgeable, attentive and professional, and made our visit delightful. Our interactions with the staff were characterized by an utter lack of pretension. We enjoyed the food, the service and the atmosphere immensely.",La Grenouille,23-Jul-11,Kory Warr

"Our first act: La Grenouille . This almost 50 year-old institution is dedicated to classic French cuisine. The story goes that La Grenouille first opened its doors on a snowy evening in 1962 and to this day remains largely unchanged. The setting is a mirrored and slightly dated dining room, overflowing with an unfathomable amount of fresh flowers, which add vibrant colors and fragrance to the intimate spa ...

  On our quest to get some soup and/or Ramen, my dining crew decided to stop into Mis Korea BBQ in Koreatown the other day, to do just that. Upon entering the restaurant, the hostess sent us to the third floor, which was modern, spacious and clean. The large, open windows overlooking Koreatown, made for a great very chic ambiance. ...

  I like the atmosphere of this restaurant and also love korean BBQ in general so this place is perfect for me. The only disadvantage: it's a little pricey- for a meat plate u need to pay around 30$ and more, vegetables one 25$ and usually you need to order more of them to get full. But still, from time to time it's nice to visit this restaurant. I like the variety of korean appetizers and also that you can prepare the meat exactly the way you like- in my case well done.
Moreover usually after visiting places similar to this one your hair, clothes smell like a BBQ. After Miss Korea is not bad so I think they have a good ventilation.",Miss Korea BBQ,15-Jul-16,Blue_lagoon

  Came here for lunch on Wednesday with a friend on her lunch break! I chose Miss Korea because of the yuk gae jang (spicy beef soup) which is my go to Korean dish back in Auckland.

We were seated quickly and service was friendly and efficient! As soon as we made our orders they brought out eight side dishes! Yuuuuum it was nice to see some of my favourites! The seaweed is still my fave side dish and tastes just as good here as it does in New Zealand! My soup came out shortly after! My rice was nice and fluffy and the soup was delicious! It was flavorful and the perfect amount of spicy. My friend got the cod soup and she liked that as well.

I wish we had a little bit more time than an hour to eat though because we were slightly rushed and I couldn't finish my soup! I would definitely come back here!

  Ooh. Everytime I'm in Manhattan i come here. I love their food and how many side dishes you get and the service is great! They keep coming back and asking if you'd like more of anything. As well, if you order the grilled mackerel they bring it out and clean off the bones and cut it up into bite size pieces so you dont have to do any work! Talk about service! Everything I've ordered has always been on point with authentic Korean flavors. I'm Korean so i would know :)",Miss Korea BBQ,12-Dec-15,Korean Food Monster

  I ordered the Jopchae (sea food Jopchae), which was a noodle dish, the Korean pancakes (which had green spring onion and seafood) and the bbq which the serves cuts and prepares.
Of course the small side dishes are always good.
I will say though that when the restaurant was close to wrapping up the server came up and asked us to wrap up. I'm not sure how I feel about that... It was only about 10:00 pm or so...
Anyway. A good one time experience overall.",Miss Korea BBQ,20-Sep-15,Ali Khan

"Amazing food and fantastic service!. There are a number of Korean BBQ restaurants in k-town, but seriously miss Korea's food and service are the best.
I love their kalbi and bulgogi. They taste amazing, and many people already know that miss korea bbq has a high-quality banchan selection. Personally my favorite menu is Raw beer tartare and seafood soft tofu stew. Aww I want them so bad right now..
At late night, you can get discounts on a number of menus which is a great deal! I can't even remember all because they do a lot of events, so if you're interested, go check their website for more info. Highly recommended.",Miss Korea BBQ,6-Jul-12,Anna
"Had a few out-of-towners to entertain and I was in charge of picking the place to eat. Usually, I'm OK with this pressure, but these guys were foodies, so it was time to step it up. I really love introducing people to cuisines that they can't get in their hometowns and Korean BBQ is usually a good choice. One of my Korean-American friends had high praise for Miss Korea, so I took a gamble and told them to meet me there. As we sat down, I had the realization that this was my first time to Korean BBQ joint without my Korean friends. Usually, they order everything in Korean and I just sit back and let a ton of delicious food magically appear on the table. *gulp* I am familiar enough with Korean food to know to order the Kimchi Pancakes, Bibimbap, Bulgogi and Kalbi. Our waiter also recommended adding another dish which helped us have the perfect amount of food! The risk of picking someplace new paid off 100% and we left incredibly happy with our meal. A perfect choice for a ...
